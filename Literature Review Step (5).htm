  <td class=xl685148 width=1875 style='border-left:none;width:1406pt'>Background:
  The global shortage of mental health workers has prompted the utilization of
  technological advancements, such as chatbots, to meet the needs of people
  with mental health conditions. Chatbots are systems that are able to converse
  and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language.
  While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using
  chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those
  studies. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety
  of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling
  the results of previous studies. Methods: A systematic review was carried out
  to achieve this objective. The search sources were 7 bibliographic databases
  (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO), the search engine “Google Scholar,” and
  backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and
  relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted
  data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Data extracted
  from studies were synthesized using narrative and statistical methods, as
  appropriate. Results: Of 1048 citations retrieved, we identified 12 studies
  examining the effect of using chatbots on 8 outcomes. Weak evidence
  demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress,
  stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was
  no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective
  psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of
  chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect. Only
  two studies assessed the safety of chatbots and concluded that they are safe
  in mental health, as no adverse events or harms were reported. Conclusions:
  Chatbots have the potential to improve mental health. However, the evidence
  in this review was not sufficient to definitely conclude this due to lack of
  evidence that their effect is clinically important, a lack of studies
  assessing each outcome, high risk of bias in those studies, and conflicting
  results for some outcomes. Further studies are required to draw solid
  conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of chatbots.</td>

  interest in chatbots. Next, we discuss the motivations that drive the use of
  chatbots, and we clarify chatbots' usefulness in a variety of areas.
  Moreover, we highlight the impact of social stereotypes on chatbots design.
  After clarifying necessary technological concepts, we move on to a chatbot
  classification based on various criteria, such as the area of knowledge they
  refer to, the need they serve and others. Furthermore, we present the general
  architecture of modern chatbots while also mentioning the main platforms for

  width:1406pt'>Driven by ‘success stories' reported by private sector firms,
  government agencies have also started adopting various Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) technologies in diverse domains (e.g. health, taxation, and
  education); however, extensive research is required in order to exploit the
  full potential of AI in the public sector, and leverage various AI
  technologies to address important problems/needs. This paper makes a
  contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach, as well as the
  architecture of an ICT platform supporting it, for the advanced exploitation
  of a specific AI technology, namely chatbots, in the public sector in order
  to address a crucial issue: the improvement of communication between
  government and citizens (which has for long time been problematic). The
  proposed approach builds on natural language processing, machine learning and
  data mining technologies, and leverages existing data of various forms (such
  as documents containing legislation and directives, structured data from
  government agencies' operational systems, social media data, etc.), in order
  to develop a new digital channel of communication between citizens and
  government. Making use of appropriately structured and semantically annotated
  data, this channel enables ‘richer' and more expressive interaction of
  citizens with government in everyday language, facilitating and advancing
  both information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing
  digital channels, the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range of
  citizens' interactions, with higher levels of complexity, ambiguity and
  uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government agencies (the
  Ministry of Finance, a social security organization, and a big local
  government organization), this approach has been validated through a series
  of application scenarios.</td>

  width:1406pt'>This study investigates the public's initial trust in so-called
  “artificial intelligence” (AI) chatbots about to be introduced into use in
  the public sector. While the societal impacts of AI are widely speculated
  about, empirical testing remains rare. To narrow this gap, this study builds
  on theories of operators' trust in machines in industrial settings and
  proposes that initial public trust in chatbot responses depends on (i) the
  area of enquiry, since expectations about a chatbot's performance vary with
  the topic, and (ii) the purposes that governments communicate to the public
  for introducing the use of chatbots. Analyses based on an experimental online
  survey in Japan generated results indicating that, if a government were to
  announce its intention to use “AI” chatbots to answer public enquiries, the
  public's initial trust in their responses would be lower in the area of
  parental support than in the area of waste separation, with a moderate effect
  size. Communicating purposes that would directly benefit citizens, such as
  achieving uniformity in response quality and timeliness in responding, would
  enhance public trust in chatbots. Although the effect sizes are small,
  communicating these purposes might be still worthwhile, as it would be an
  inexpensive measure for a government to take.</td>

  width:1406pt'>World Health Organization (WHO) reports that, the second major
  cause of death is cancer. Life of people who have cancer is daunting. Their
  heart is open to all negative emotions like anger, fear, depression, guilt,
  helplessness, etc. People around them are also finding it difficult to cope
  with it. They require constant support to discuss their problems with and to
  provide them with factual information. This paper introduces a potential
  solution to provide them with what they are seeking for- a chatbot. The
  proposed chatbot is a cancer chatbot designed only for people dealing with
  cancer. People can ask about anything and everything about cancer- symptoms,
  treatments, survival and so on. The bot is trained by information collected
  from various cancer forums which have a wide range of information about
  cancer. Sentiment analysis is used to identify the mood of the users so that
  the bot can give a human-like behavior and comfort them.</td>

  with their patients during the recent Coronavirus outbreak, whilst attempting
  to reduce COVID-19 transmission among patients and clinicians. Amidst the
  pandemic, Telemedicine has the potential to help by permitting patients to
  receive supportive care without having to physically visit a hospital by
  using a conversational artificial intelligence-based application for their
  treatment. Thus, telehealth will rapidly and radically transform in-person
  care to remote consultation of patients. Because of this, it developed a
  Multilingual Conversational Bot based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
  provide free primary healthcare education, information, advice to chronic
  patients. The study introduces a novel computer application acting as a
  personal virtual doctor that has been opportunely designed and extensively
  trained to interact with patients like human beings. This application is
  based upon a serverless architecture and it aggregates the services of a
  doctor by providing preventive measures, homeremedies, interactive counseling
  sessions, healthcare tips, and symptoms covering the most prevalent diseases
  in rural India. The paper proposes a conversational bot “Aapka Chikitsak” on
  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for delivering telehealth in India to increase
  the patient's access to healthcare knowledge and leverage the potentials of
  artificial intelligence to bridge the gap of demand and supply of human
  healthcare providers. This conversational application has resulted in
  reducing the barriers for access to healthcare facilities and procures
  intelligent consultations remotely to allow timely care and quality
  treatment, there by effectively assisting the society.</td>

  physical robots and virtual chatbots, to provide services to customers. While
  some firms use robots that resemble human beings by looking and acting
  humanlike to increase customers' use intention of this technology, others
  employ machinelike robots to avoid uncanny valley effects, assuming that very
  humanlike robots may induce feelings of eeriness. There is no consensus in
  the service literature regarding whether customers' anthropomorphism of
  robots facilitates or constrains their use intention. The present
  meta-analysis synthesizes data from 11,053 individuals interacting with
  service robots reported in 108 independent samples. The study synthesizes
  previous research to clarify this issue and enhance understanding of the
  construct. We develop a comprehensive model to investigate relationships
  between anthropomorphism and its antecedents and consequences. Customer
  traits and predispositions (e.g., computer anxiety), sociodemographics (e.g.,
  gender), and robot design features (e.g., physical, nonphysical) are
  identified as triggers of anthropomorphism. Robot characteristics (e.g.,
  intelligence) and functional characteristics (e.g., usefulness) are
  identified as important mediators, although relational characteristics (e.g.,
  rapport) receive less support as mediators. The findings clarify contextual
  circumstances in which anthropomorphism impacts customer intention to use a
  robot. The moderator analysis indicates that the impact depends on robot type
  (i.e., robot gender) and service type (i.e., possession-processing service,
  mental stimulus-processing service). Based on these findings, we develop a
  comprehensive agenda for future research on service robots in marketing.</td>

  on a 24/7 basis as well as online accessibility around the globe. For this
  sake, personalized software systems, called chatbots, are applied. Chatbots
  offer services, goods or information in natural language. These programs
  respond to the user in real-time and offer an intuitive and simple interface
  to interact with. Advantages like these makes them increasingly popular.
  Chatbots can even act as substitutes for humans for specific purposes. Since
  the chatbot market is growing, chatbots might outperform and replace
  classical web applications in the future. For this reason, ensuring correct
  functionality of chatbots is of high and increasing importance. However,
  since different implementations and user behavior result in unpredictable
  results, the chatbot's output is difficult to predict and classify as well.
  In fact, testing of chatbots represents a challenge because of the
  unavailability of a test oracle. In this paper, we introduce a metamorphic
  testing approach for chatbots. In general, metamorphic testing can be applied
  to situations where no expected values are available. In addition, we discuss
  how to obtain test cases for chatbots, i.e. sequences of interactions with a
  chatbot, in an according manner. We demonstrate our approach using a hotel

  appropriate way using natural language, have been of increasing importance.
  This is due the fact of the availability of computational means for natural
  language interaction between computers and humans that are becoming closer to
  the interaction between humans alone. Consequently, there are more and more
  chatbots available that are intended to support humans organizing tasks or
  making decisions. In this paper, we focus on how to verify the communication
  capabilities provided by chatbots. In particular, we introduce an automated
  approach for generating communication sequences and carrying them out. The
  approach is based on AI planning where each action can be assumed to be a
  certain question that is given to the chatbot. The answer of the chatbot
  should make the action post-condition true, in order to proceed with the
  plan. In cases of deviations between the actual chatbot behavior and the
  expected one, re-planning is required. Besides the approach, we discuss its
  application to the domain of tourism and outline a case study.</td>

  characteristics for chatbots. We analyzed 56 papers from various domains to
  understand how social characteristics can benefit human–chatbot interactions
  and identify the challenges and strategies to designing them. Additionally,
  we discussed how characteristics may influence one another. Our results
  provide relevant opportunities to both researchers and designers to advance
  human–chatbot interactions.</td>

  major developments in botics and more widespread usage of virtual agents in
  personal and professional sphere. The general purpose of the experiment was
  to thoroughly examine the character of the human–non-human interaction
  process. Thus, in the paper, we present a study of human–chatbot interaction,
  focusing on the affective responses of users to different types of interfaces
  with which they interact. The experiment consisted of two parts: measurement
  of psychophysiological reactions of chatbot users and a detailed
  questionnaire that focused on assessing interactions and willingness to
  collaborate with a bot. In the first quantitative stage, participants
  interacted with a chatbot, either with a simple text chatbot (control group)
  or an avatar reading its responses in addition to only presenting them on the
  screen (experimental group. We gathered the following psychophysiological
  data from participants: electromyography (EMG), respirometer (RSP),
  electrocardiography (ECG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). In the last,
  declarative stage, participants filled out a series of questionnaires related
  to the experience of interacting with (chat)bots and to the overall
  human–(chat)bot collaboration assessment. The theory of planned behaviour
  survey investigated attitude towards cooperation with chatbots in the future.
  The social presence survey checked how much the chatbot was considered to be
  a “real” person. The anthropomorphism scale measured the extent to which the
  chatbot seems humanlike. Our particular focus was on the so-called uncanny
  valley effect, consisting of the feeling of eeriness and discomfort towards a
  given medium or technology that frequently appears in various kinds of
  human–machine interactions. Our results show that participants were
  experiencing lesser uncanny effects and less negative affect in cooperation
  with a simpler text chatbot than with the more complex, animated avatar
  chatbot. The simple chatbot have also induced less intense
  psychophysiological reactions. Despite major developments in botics, the
  user's affective responses towards bots have frequently been neglected. In
  our view, understanding the user's side may be crucial for designing better
  chatbots in the future and, thus, can contribute to advancing the field of
  human–computer interaction.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Background: Chatbots could be a scalable solution that provides
  an interactive means of engaging users in behavioral health interventions
  driven by artificial intelligence. Although some chatbots have shown
  promising early efficacy results, there is limited information about how
  people use these chatbots. Understanding the usage patterns of chatbots for
  depression represents a crucial step toward improving chatbot design and
  providing information about the strengths and limitations of the chatbots.
  Objective: This study aims to understand how users engage and are redirected
  through a chatbot for depression (Tess) to provide design recommendations.
  Methods: Interactions of 354 users with the Tess depression modules were
  analyzed to understand chatbot usage across and within modules. Descriptive
  statistics were used to analyze participant flow through each depression
  module, including characters per message, completion rate, and time spent per
  module. Slide plots were also used to analyze the flow across and within
  modules. Results: Users sent a total of 6220 messages, with a total of 86,298
  characters, and, on average, they engaged with Tess depression modules for 46
  days. There was large heterogeneity in user engagement across different
  modules, which appeared to be affected by the length, complexity, content,
  and style of questions within the modules and the routing between modules.
  Conclusions: Overall, participants engaged with Tess; however, there was a
  heterogeneous usage pattern because of varying module designs. Major
  implications for future chatbot design and evaluation are discussed in the
  paper.</td>

  improve developer productivity. Current research in this area is held back by
  a lack of consensus of what software engineering bots (DevBots) actually are,
  what characteristics distinguish them from other tools, and what benefits and
  challenges are associated with DevBot usage. In this paper we report on a
  mixed-method empirical study of DevBot usage in industrial practice. We
  report on findings from interviewing 21 and surveying a total of 111
  developers. We identify three different personas among DevBot users (focusing
  on autonomy, chat interfaces, and &quot;smartness&quot;), each with different
  definitions of what a DevBot is, why developers use them, and what they
  struggle with.We conclude that future DevBot research should situate their
  work within our framework, to clearly identify what type of bot the work
  targets, and what advantages practitioners can expect. Further, we find that
  there currently is a lack of general purpose &quot;smart&quot;bots that go
  beyond simple automation tools or chat interfaces. This is problematic, as we
  have seen that such bots, if available, can have a transformative effect on
  the projects that use them.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Conversational agents (CAs) are software-based systems designed
  to interact with humans using natural language and have attracted
  considerable research interest in recent years. Following the Computers Are
  Social Actors paradigm, many studies have shown that humans react socially to
  CAs when they display social cues such as small talk, gender, age, gestures,
  or facial expressions. However, research on social cues for CAs is scattered
  across different fields, often using their specific terminology, which makes
  it challenging to identify, classify, and accumulate existing knowledge. To
  address this problem, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify
  an initial set of social cues of CAs from existing research. Building on
  classifications from interpersonal communication theory, we developed a
  taxonomy that classifies the identified social cues into four major
  categories (i.e., verbal, visual, auditory, invisible) and ten subcategories.
  Subsequently, we evaluated the mapping between the identified social cues and
  the categories using a card sorting approach in order to verify that the
  taxonomy is natural, simple, and parsimonious. Finally, we demonstrate the
  usefulness of the taxonomy by classifying a broader and more generic set of
  social cues of CAs from existing research and practice. Our main contribution
  is a comprehensive taxonomy of social cues for CAs. For researchers, the
  taxonomy helps to systematically classify research about social cues into one
  of the taxonomy's categories and corresponding subcategories. Therefore, it
  builds a bridge between different research fields and provides a starting
  point for interdisciplinary research and knowledge accumulation. For
  practitioners, the taxonomy provides a systematic overview of relevant
  categories of social cues in order to identify, implement, and test their
  effects in the design of a CA.</td>

  in shared service centres (SSCs) can hardly be overlooked. This article,
  therefore, draws on the institutional theory to widen the understanding of
  its implementation and outcomes regarding people management. Drawing on the
  lens of the institutional theory and the literature on SSCs and RPA, this
  study addresses the key challenges and outcomes of robotization.
  Design/methodology/approach: The study follows a qualitative approach and a
  purposeful sampling design that collected data from six major SSCs)
  introducing robotization. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews
  with service representatives, including RPA project managers. A thematic
  content analysis was used. Findings: The introduction of robotics follows
  mechanisms of coercive, normative and mimetic isomorphism and is effectively
  replacing workers. So far, this process has been managed through a few
  reactive people management practices, such as earlier retirements, internal
  mobility and outsourcing reduction, which warns of future tensions. The
  findings also show the emergence of new jobs, such as robot developers and
  robot managers. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the limited
  empirical body of research in RPA in SSCs. The study is novel as it is one of
  the first offering an implementation roadmap for other SSCs and illustrates
  the positive impact on processes redesign. It also provides empirical
  evidence on the debate about the potential for service workers' replacement
  versus tasks augmentation. In the longer term, this study opens new research
  avenues related to the tensions and contradictions from the progressive
  institutionalization of robotization in service organizations.</td>

  users of two chatbots for customer service. Our results demonstrate the
  importance of such chatbots to efficiently provide adequate answers in
  response to simple enquiries. However, our results also show that the
  occasional lack of adequate answers does not necessarily produce a bad
  experience, as long as the chatbot offers an easy path for follow-up with
  human customer service representatives. In contrast to what is suggested in
  the existing literature on users' perceptions of conversational agents, this
  study's participants demonstrated realistic expectations of the chatbots'
  capabilities. Furthermore, we found that the human likeness of chatbots for
  customer service, while potentially of some relevance for user experience, is
  dwarfed in importance compared to such chatbots' ability to efficiently and
  adequately handle enquiries. As such, our findings serve to complement and
  extend current knowledge. On the basis of our findings, we suggest

  conversational chatbot platforms. Even though artificial intelligence is
  still too immature to support satisfactory user experience in many mass
  market domains, conversational interfaces have found their way into ad hoc
  applications such as call centres and online shopping assistants. However,
  they have not been applied so far to social inclusion of elderly people, who
  are particularly vulnerable to the digital divide. Many of them relieve their
  loneliness with traditional media such as TV and radio, which are known to
  create a feeling of companionship. In this paper we present the EBER chatbot,
  designed to reduce the digital gap for the elderly. EBER reads news in the
  background and adapts its responses to the user's mood. Its novelty lies in
  the concept of 'intelligent radio', according to which, instead of
  simplifying a digital information system to make it accessible to the
  elderly, a traditional channel they find familiar -background news- is
  augmented with interactions via voice dialogues. We make it possible by
  combining Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language, automatic Natural
  Language Generation and Sentiment Analysis. The system allows accessing
  digital content of interest by combining words extracted from user answers to
  chatbot questions with keywords extracted from the news items. This approach
  permits defining metrics of the abstraction capabilities of the users
  depending on a spatial representation of the word space. To prove the
  suitability of the proposed solution we present results of real experiments
  conducted with elderly people that provided valuable insights. Our approach
  was considered satisfactory during the tests and improved the information
  search capabilities of the participants.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Chatbots are replacing human agents in a number of domains,
  from online tutoring to customer-service to even cognitive therapy. But, they
  are often machine-like in their interactions. What can we do to humanize
  chatbots? Should they necessarily be driven by human operators for them to be
  considered human? Or, will an anthropomorphic visual cue on the interface
  and/or a high-level of contingent message exchanges provide humanness to
  automated chatbots? We explored these questions with a 2 (anthropomorphic
  visual cues: high vs. low anthropomorphism) × 2 (message interactivity: high
  vs. low message interactivity) × 2 (identity cue: chat-bot vs. human)
  between-subjects experiment (N = 141) in which participants interacted with a
  chat agent on an e-commerce site about choosing a digital camera to purchase.
  Our findings show that a high level of message interactivity compensates for
  the impersonal nature of a chatbot that is low on anthropomorphic visual
  cues. Moreover, identifying the agent as human raises user expectations for
  interactivity. Theoretical as well as practical implications of these
  findings are discussed.</td>

  with the knowledge acquired from the successive interactions. In addition,
  the selection of the next system response is adapted considering information
  stored into user's profiles and also the emotional contents detected in the

  development of an embodied conversational agent which has been placed in the
  Second Life social virtual world. The avatar includes the different models
  and interacts with the users who inhabit the virtual world in order to
  provide academic information. The experimental results show that the agent's

  self-feeding chatbot, a dialogue agent with the ability to extract new
  training examples from the conversations it participates in. As our agent
  engages in conversation, it also estimates user satisfaction in its
  responses. When the conversation appears to be going well, the user's
  responses become new training examples to imitate. When the agent believes it
  has made a mistake, it asks for feedback; learning to predict the feedback
  that will be given improves the chatbot's dialogue abilities further. On the
  PERSONACHAT chitchat dataset with over 131k training examples, we find that
  learning from dialogue with a self-feeding chatbot significantly improves
  performance, regardless of the amount of traditional supervision.</td>

  account for 10{\%} of colorectal cancers but remain underdiagnosed. This
  feasibility project tested the utility of an artificial intelligence-based
  chatbot deployed to patients scheduled for colonoscopy to identify HCRC risk
  factors, educate participants about HCRC and obtain consent to genetic
  testing as an extension of genetic counselling of appropriate subjects.
  Genetic counsellor (GC) and genetic counselling assistant (GCA) time spent
  per subject was also measured. Methods Patients scheduled for colonoscopy at
  Cleveland Clinic were invited via electronic medical record patient portal or
  letter prior to colonoscopy with a link to a chatbot administering the Colon
  Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (CCRAT) to screen for HCRC syndromes. Those with
  &#8805;1 positive response to a CCRAT question received chatbot-deployed
  genetic education and the option to receive genetic testing. An order for a
  55-gene pan-cancer panel was placed for those consenting, and the subject had
  blood drawn on the day of colonoscopy. Results were disclosed by a GC or GCA
  by telephone. Subject demographics, progression through the chat, responses
  to CCRAT, personal and family history, genetic test results and communication
  with the subject were recorded. Descriptive statistics and two-tailed
  unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test were used. Results 506/4254
  (11.9{\%}) initiated and 487 (96.2{\%}) completed the chat with the chatbot.
  215 (44.1{\%}) answered yes to &#8805;1 CCRAT question and all completed
  pretest education. 129/181 (71.3{\%}) subjects who consented completed
  testing, and 12 (9.3{\%}) were found to have a germline pathogenic variant.
  Per subject, the GC spent a mean of 14.3 (SD 7.3) and the GCA a mean of 19.2
  (SD 9.8) minutes. Conclusion The use of a chatbot in this setting was a novel
  and feasible method, with the potential of increasing genetic screening and
  testing in individuals at risk of HCRC syndromes.</td>

  of clinical genomic data for risk of preventable conditions (‘additional
  findings') by developing a chatbot (electronic genetic resource, ‘eDNA').
  Methods: Interactions in pre-test genetic counseling sessions (13.5 h) about
  additional findings were characterized using proponent, thematic and semantic
  analyses of transcripts. We then wrote interfaces to draw supplementary data
  from external genetics applications. To create Edna, this content was
  programmed using a chatbot framework which interacts with patients via
  speech-to-text. Results: Conditions, terms, explanations of concepts, and key
  factors to consider in decision making were all encoded into chatbot
  conversations emulating counseling session flows. Patient agency can be
  enhanced by prompted consideration of the personal and familial implications
  of testing. Similarly, health literacy can be broadened through explanation
  of genetic conditions and terminology. Novel aspects include sentiment
  analysis and collection of family history. Medical advice and the impact of
  existing genetic conditions were deemed inappropriate for inclusion.
  Conclusion: Edna's successful development represents a movement towards
  accessible, acceptable and well-supported digital health processes for
  patients to make informed decisions for additional findings. Practice
  implications: Edna complements genetic counseling by collecting and providing
  genomic information before or after pre-test consultations.</td>

  we present kBot, a knowledge-enabled personalized chatbot system designed for
  health applications and adapted to help pediatric asthmatic patients (age 8
  to 15) to better control their asthma. Its core functionalities include
  continuous monitoring of the patient's medication adherence and tracking of
  relevant health signals and environment data. kBot takes the form of an
  Android application with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in
  both text and voice, and a backend cloud-based server application that
  handles data collection, processing, and dialogue management. It achieves
  contextualization by piecing together domain knowledge from online sources
  and inputs from our clinical partners. The personalization aspect is derived
  from patient answering questionnaires and day-to-day conversations. kBot's
  preliminary evaluation focused on chatbot quality, technology acceptance, and
  system usability involved eight asthma clinicians and eight researchers. For
  both groups, kBot achieved an overall technology acceptance value of greater
  than 8 on the 11-point Likert scale and a mean System Usability Score (SUS)
  greater than 80. A demo of our kBot application is available at this URL:

  about the challenges and opportunities of social media with a call to action:
  “Users of the world, unite!” To celebrate its anniversary, we look at
  artificial intelligence and the need to create the rules necessary for
  peaceful coexistence between humanity and AI. Hence, we now are urging:
  “Rulers of the world, unite!” In this article, we outline six debates
  surrounding AI in areas like artificial superintelligence, geographical
  progress, and robotics; in doing so, we shed light on what is fact and what
  is utopia. Then, using the PESTEL framework, we talk about the six dilemmas
  of AI and its potential threat and use. Finally, we provide six directions on
  the future of AI regarding its requirements and expectations, looking at
  enforcement, employment, ethics, education, entente, and evolution.
  Understanding AI's potential future will enable governments, corporations,
  and societies at large (i.e., the rulers of this world) to prepare for its
  challenges and opportunities. This way, we can avoid a scenario in which we
  return in 10 years to write the article: “Dreamers of the world, unite!”</td>

  natural language user interfaces is seeing increasing use in health care
  applications, shaping the content, structure, or purpose of the dialogue
  between humans and conversational agents. Objective: The goal of this
  systematic review was to understand the ways in which personalization has
  been used with conversational agents in health care and characterize the
  methods of its implementation. Methods: We searched on PubMed, Embase,
  CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital Library using a predefined search strategy.
  The studies were included if they: (1) were primary research studies that
  focused on consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved
  a conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface; (3)
  tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented personalization
  features. Results: The search found 1958 publications. After abstract and
  full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common examples
  of personalized content included feedback, daily health reports, alerts,
  warnings, and recommendations. The personalization features were implemented
  without a theoretical framework of customization and with limited evaluation
  of its impact. While conversational agents with personalization features were
  reported to improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality,
  the role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed
  directly. Conclusions: Most of the studies in our review implemented the
  personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support for
  them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains of
  personalization. Future research could incorporate personalization as a distinct
  design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact on health
  outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and
  decision-making.</td>

  intentions to improve preconception behaviour and anxiety? Design: A
  three-armed, randomized controlled trial was conducted using an online social
  research panel. Participants included 927 women aged 20–34 years who were
  randomly allocated to one of three groups: a fertility education chatbot
  (intervention group), a document about fertility and preconception health
  (control group 1) or a document about an irrelevant topic (control group 2).
  Participants' scores on the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and the
  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, their intentions to optimize preconception
  behaviours, e.g. taking folic acid, and the free-text feedback provided by
  chatbot users were assessed. Results: A repeated-measures analysis of
  variance showed significant fertility knowledge gains after the intervention
  in the intervention group (+9.1 points) and control group 1 (+14.9 points)
  but no significant change in control group 2 (+1.1 points). Post-test
  increases in the intentions to optimize behaviours were significantly higher
  in the intervention group than in control group 2, and were similar to those
  in control group 1. Post-test state anxiety scores were significantly lower
  in the intervention group than in control group 1 and control group 2. User
  feedbacks about the chatbot suggested technical limitations, e.g. low
  comprehension of users' words, and pros and cons of using the chatbot, e.g.
  convenient versus coldness. Conclusions: Providing fertility education using
  a chatbot improved fertility knowledge and intentions to optimize
  preconception behaviour without increasing anxiety, but the improvement in
  knowledge was small. Further technical development and exploration of
  personal affinity for technology is required.</td>

  and advantages of this technology as a complement to psychotherapeutic
  interventions for the prevention and treatment of depression, anxiety, or
  post-traumatic stress disorder, to name a few. A small number of these works
  implement capabilities in the virtual agent focused on the detection and

  the development of an embodied conversational agent used as the main
  interface in HelPath, a mobile-based application addressed to individuals
  detected with any of the suicidal behaviours: ideation, planning or attempt.
  The main objective of HelPath is to continuously collect user's information
  that, complemented with data from the electronic health record, supports the
  identification of risks associated with suicidality. Through the virtual
  agent, the users also receive information and suggestions based on cognitive
  behaviour therapy that would help them to maintain a healthy condition. The
  paper also presents the execution of an exploratory pilot to assess the
  acceptability, perception and adherence of users towards the virtual agent.

  further improvement of the embodied conversational agent are also identified.</td>

  growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of
  conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related
  activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring,
  training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free
  clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to
  health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability,
  usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to
  collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for
  improvement and potential for sustainable adoption. Objective: This
  systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of
  conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users
  like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents.
  Methods: PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL
  (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science,
  and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were
  systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated
  unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in
  health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management
  software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was
  conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was
  assessed by one reviewer and validated by another. Results: A total of 31
  studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents,
  including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied
  conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls,
  virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual
  question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the
  evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction
  performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was
  found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several
  limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback.
  Conclusions: The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for
  the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational
  agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The
  quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and
  reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the
  agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further
  research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of
  the agents.</td>

  width:1406pt'>OBJECTIVE: To examine user uptake and experience with a
  clinical chatbot that automates hereditary cancer risk triage by collecting
  personal and family cancer history in routine women's health care settings.
  METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective observational study of
  patients who used a web-based chatbot before routine care appointments to
  assess their risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome,
  and adenomatous polyposis syndromes. Outcome measures included uptake and completion
  of the risk-assessment and educational section of the chatbot interaction and
  identification of hereditary cancer risk as evaluated against National
  Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. RESULTS: Of the 95,166 patients
  invited, 61,070 (64.2{\%}) engaged with the clinical chatbot. The vast
  majority completed the cancer risk assessment (89.4{\%}), and most completed
  the genetic testing education section (71.4{\%}), indicating high
  acceptability among those who opted to engage. The mean duration of use was
  15.4 minutes (SD 2 hours, 56.2 minutes) when gaps of inactivity longer than 5
  minutes were excluded. A personal history of cancer was reported by 19.1{\%}
  (10,849/56,656) and a family history of cancer was reported by 66.7{\%}
  (36,469/54,652) of patients who provided the relevant information. One in
  four patients (14,850/54,547) screened with the chatbot before routine care
  appointments met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for genetic
  testing. Among those who were tested, 5.6{\%} (73/1,313) had a
  disease-causing pathogenic variant. CONCLUSION: A chatbot digital health tool
  can help identify patients at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes
  before routine care appointments. This scalable intervention can effectively
  provide cancer risk assessment, engage patients with educational information,
  and facilitate a path toward preventive genetic testing. FUNDING SOURCE:
  Implementation of the chatbot in clinics was funded by industry support from
  commercial genetic testing laboratories Ambry, Invitae, and Progenity.</td>

  extended with the introduction of a new task on medical semantic indexing in
  Spanish. In total, 34 teams with more than 100 systems participated in the
  three tasks of the challenge. As in previous years, the results of the
  evaluation reveal that the top-performing systems managed to outperform the
  strong baselines, which suggests that state-of-the-art systems keep pushing

  take a multi-staged approach where both the processes (intent-classification

  The model breaks down the problem into stages, solving one problem at a time
  and passing on relevant results of the current stage to the next, thereby
  reducing search space for subsequent stages, and eventually making
  classification and tagging more viable after each stage. We also observe that
  relaxing rules for a fuzzy entity-matching in slot-tagging after each stage
  (by maintaining a separate Named Entity Tagger per stage) helps us improve
  performance, although at a slight cost of false-positives. Our model has
  achieved state-of-the-art performance with F1-score of 77.63{\%} for
  intent-classification and 82.24{\%} for slot-tagging on our dataset that we

  well-established treatment for panic disorder, but many fewer patients
  receive this treatment compared to medication-based therapy. Mobile app-based
  interactive CBT using a chatbot can increase patient access to CBT. We
  performed a preliminary study to determine whether short-term use of a newly
  developed chatbot is feasible and effective for relieving panic symptoms.
  Method: Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to either a chatbot group
  (n = 21) or control group (n = 20) for a period of 4 weeks. The chatbot group
  was guided in the use of the chatbot application, while the control group was
  provided with a book on panic disorder. Main results: The severity of panic
  disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group, but not in the
  control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and the
  control helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group
  compared to the control group. Discussion and conclusion: We found that
  mobile app-based interactive CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective
  for reducing the severity of panic symptoms. Using this novel approach to
  provide CBT would allow clinicians to effect positive therapeutic outcomes
  with easy accessibility, interactivity, and self-management for patients with
  panic symptoms.</td>

  therapeutic chatbot which distributes the text into emotion labels namely,
  Happy, Joy, Shame, Anger, Disgust, Sadness, Guilt, and Fear. Further, based
  on the emotion label, it identify the users' mental state such as stressed or
  depressed using users' chat data. For emotion detection, we deployed three
  popular deep learning classifiers namely, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
  Recurrent Neural Network (CNN), and Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN). In
  particular, the proposed methodology of the chatbot is domain specific where
  through the users' interaction, the chatbot will try to prevent the

  well. Approximately 3 out of 4 participants preferred the VCA interface to
  the standard one. Although the overall time taken was slightly longer than
  with standard interface, the VCA interface was rated significantly better
  across all other measures and was preferred by the participants. These

  around text-based chatbots, software applications interacting with humans
  using natural written language. However, despite the enthusiastic market
  predictions, ‘conversing' with this kind of agents seems to raise issues that
  go beyond their current technological limitations, directly involving the
  human side of interaction. By adopting a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
  lens, in this article we present a systematic literature review of 83 papers that
  focus on how users interact with text-based chatbots. We map the relevant
  themes that are recurrent in the last ten years of research, describing how
  people experience the chatbot in terms of satisfaction, engagement, and
  trust, whether and why they accept and use this technology, how they are
  emotionally involved, what kinds of downsides can be observed in
  human-chatbot conversations, and how the chatbot is perceived in terms of its
  humanness. On the basis of these findings, we highlight open issues in
  current research and propose a number of research opportunities that could be
  tackled in future years.</td>

  questions with answers, obtained from 8k conversations about text passages
  from seven diverse domains. The questions are conversational, and the answers
  are free-form text with their corresponding evidence highlighted in the
  passage. We analyze CoQA in depth and show that conversational questions have
  challenging phenomena not present in existing reading comprehension datasets
  (e.g., coreference and pragmatic reasoning). We evaluate strong dialogue and
  reading comprehension models on CoQA. The best system obtains an F1 score of
  65.4{\%}, which is 23.4 points behind human performance (88.8{\%}),

  width:1406pt'>Background: Chatbots are applications that can conduct natural
  language conversations with users. In the medical field, chatbots have been
  developed and used to serve different purposes. They provide patients with
  timely information that can be critical in some scenarios, such as access to
  mental health resources. Since the development of the first chatbot, ELIZA,
  in the late 1960s, much effort has followed to produce chatbots for various
  health purposes developed in different ways. Objective: This study aimed to
  explore the technical aspects and development methodologies associated with
  chatbots used in the medical field to explain the best methods of development
  and support chatbot development researchers on their future work. Methods: We
  searched for relevant articles in 8 literature databases (IEEE, ACM,
  Springer, ScienceDirect, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar). We
  also performed forward and backward reference checking of the selected
  articles. Study selection was performed by one reviewer, and 50{\%} of the
  selected studies were randomly checked by a second reviewer. A narrative
  approach was used for result synthesis. Chatbots were classified based on the
  different technical aspects of their development. The main chatbot components
  were identified in addition to the different techniques for implementing each
  module. Results: The original search returned 2481 publications, of which we
  identified 45 studies that matched our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
  most common language of communication between users and chatbots was English
  (n=23). We identified 4 main modules: text understanding module, dialog
  management module, database layer, and text generation module. The most
  common technique for developing text understanding and dialogue management is
  the pattern matching method (n=18 and n=25, respectively). The most common
  text generation is fixed output (n=36). Very few studies relied on generating
  original output. Most studies kept a medical knowledge base to be used by the
  chatbot for different purposes throughout the conversations. A few studies
  kept conversation scripts and collected user data and previous conversations.
  Conclusions: Many chatbots have been developed for medical use, at an
  increasing rate. There is a recent, apparent shift in adopting machine
  learning–based approaches for developing chatbot systems. Further research
  can be conducted to link clinical outcomes to different chatbot development
  techniques and technical characteristics.</td>

  width:1406pt'>A barrier to incorporating genomics more broadly is limited
  access to providers with genomics expertise. Chatbots are a technology-based
  simulated conversation used in scaling communications. Geisinger and Clear
  Genetics, Inc. have developed chatbots to facilitate communication with
  participants receiving clinically actionable genetic variants from the
  MyCode{\textregistered} Community Health Initiative
  (MyCode{\textregistered}). The consent chatbot walks patients through the
  consent allowing them to opt to receive more or less detail on key topics
  (goals, benefits, risks, etc.). The follow-up chatbot reminds participants of
  suggested actions following result receipt and the cascade chatbot can be
  sent to at-risk relatives by participants to share their genetic test results
  and facilitate cascade testing. To explore the acceptability, usability, and
  understanding of the study consent, post-result follow-up and cascade testing
  chatbots, we conducted six focus groups with MyCode{\textregistered} participants.
  Sixty-two individuals participated in a focus group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;33 consent
  chatbot, n&nbsp;=&nbsp;29 follow-up and cascade chatbot). Participants were
  mostly female (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;42, 68{\%}), Caucasian (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;58,
  94{\%}), college-educated (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;33,53{\%}), retirees
  (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;38, 61{\%}), and of age 56&nbsp;years or older
  (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;52, 84{\%}).&nbsp;Few participants reported that they knew
  what a chatbot was (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, 16{\%}), and a small number reported
  that they had used a chatbot (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, 8{\%}). Qualitative analysis
  of transcripts and notes from focus groups revealed four main themes: (a)
  overall impressions, (b) suggested improvements, (c) concerns and
  limitations, and (d) implementation. Participants supported using chatbots to
  consent for genomics research and to interact with healthcare providers for
  care coordination following receipt of genomic results. Most expressed
  willingness to use a chatbot to share genetic information with relatives. The
  consent chatbot presents an engaging alternative to deliver content
  challenging to comprehend in traditional paper or in-person consent. The
  cascade and follow-up chatbots may be acceptable, user-friendly, scalable
  approaches to manage ancillary genetic counseling tasks.</td>

  health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the
  implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed.
  Objective: In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form
  of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in
  health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the
  implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the
  framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up,
  Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). Methods:
  After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as
  falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest
  these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and
  that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be
  decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML
  initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically
  including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent,
  algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the
  changing nature of health care work. Results: Ultimately, we suggest that the
  future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from
  patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is
  necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. Conclusions: If the
  implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways
  that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper
  will require substantial attention in the coming years.</td>

  width:1406pt'>With the exponential growth in the mobile device market over
  the last decade, chatbots are becoming an increasingly popular option to
  interact with users, and their popularity and adoption are rapidly spreading.
  These mobile devices change the way we communicate and allow ever-present
  learning in various environments. This study examined educational chatbots
  for Facebook Messenger to support learning. The independent web directory was
  screened to assess chatbots for this study resulting in the identification of
  89 unique chatbots. Each chatbot was classified by language, subject matter
  and developer's platform. Finally, we evaluated 47 educational chatbots using
  the Facebook Messenger platform based on the analytic hierarchy process
  against the quality attributes of teaching, humanity, affect, and
  accessibility. We found that educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger
  platform vary from the basic level of sending personalized messages to
  recommending learning content. Results show that chatbots which are part of
  the instant messaging application are still in its early stages to become
  artificial intelligence teaching assistants. The findings provide tips for
  teachers to integrate chatbots into classroom practice and advice what types
  of chatbots they can try out.</td>

  elicit user engagement and stimulate actual use of eHealth applications. In
  this literature review, we identify the researched design features for ECAs
  in eHealth, the outcome variables that were used to measure the effect of
  these design features and what the found effects for each variable were.
  Searches were performed in Scopus, ACM Digital Library, PsychINFO, Pubmed and
  IEEE Xplore Digital Library, resulting in 1284 identified articles of which
  33 articles were included. The agents speech and/or textual output and its
  facial and gaze expressions were the most common design features. Little
  research was performed on the agent's looks. The measured effect of these
  design features was often on the perception of the agent's and user's
  characteristics, relation with the agent, system usage, intention to use,
  usability and behaviour change. Results show that emotion and relational
  behaviour seem to positively affect the perception of the agents
  characteristics and that relational behaviour also seems to positively affect
  the relation with the agent, usability and intention to use. However, these
  design features do not necessarily lead to behaviour change. This review
  showed that consensus on design features of ECAs in eHealth is far from
  established. Follow-up research should include more research on the effects
  of all design features, especially research on the effects in a long-term,
  daily life setting, and replication of studies on the effects of design
  features performed in other contexts than eHealth.</td>

  evidence for conversational agents or chatbots in the field of psychiatry and
  their role in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses.
  Methods: A systematic literature search in June 2018 was conducted in PubMed,
  EmBase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. Studies were
  included that involved a chatbot in a mental health setting focusing on
  populations with or at high risk of developing depression, anxiety, schizophrenia,
  bipolar, and substance abuse disorders. Results: From the selected databases,
  1466 records were retrieved and 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two
  additional studies were included from reference list screening for a total of
  10 included studies. Overall, potential for conversational agents in
  psychiatric use was reported to be high across all studies. In particular,
  conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and
  self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across
  all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in
  psychiatric treatment. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use
  of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed
  studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to
  more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents.
  Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research,
  the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric
  treatment.</td>

  conversational interfaces (namely chatbots) under a semiotic perspective. A
  chatbot is a software system that allows you to simulate real conversations
  between devices and users by means of a conversational interface (CI). After
  introducing the chatbot concept, focusing on its advantages and issues, we
  will present two domains of use in which chatbot interfaces can be effective:
  healthcare and smart home. For carrying out simple tasks such as finding information
  or triggering operations, users need an easy-to-use and to an easy-to-learn
  system to communicate with. To face this, conversational interfaces represent
  the latest trend in the field of digital design. For studying the
  communicability aspects of a CI, we carried out a user test to compare
  traditional and chatbot interfaces. This paper aims at evaluating the
  benefits at the communicability level of a chatbot in comparison to
  traditional GUI for incrementing the effectiveness and efficacy of communication
  between users and the system specifically for users with poor attitude in
  using technologies. In details, we evaluated the communicability of two
  prototypes that can be used to solve simple tasks in order to favour user
  inclusion, including everyone with very little exposure to technologies.</td>

  therefore of interest to research to which degree newer, advanced technologies
  such as Chatbots are able to improve, change and restructure public service
  delivery. This paper gives an exploratory insight using desktop research into
  three Chatbots currently used in the public administrations of Latvia, Vienna

  can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with
  users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the
  promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions
  to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. Objective: The purposes of
  this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot
  use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI
  chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive
  interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and
  considerations. Methods: We conducted a preliminary search of studies
  reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four
  databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot
  studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research
  and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps
  and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and
  findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Results: Our review
  found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical
  recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs.
  The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four
  components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics
  and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3)
  building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms
  and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation
  choices for this model are presented in this paper. Conclusions: As AI chatbots
  become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our
  proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope
  of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all
  possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and
  evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue
  developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive
  capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical
  principles.</td>

  design, cast human– machine social chat as decision-making over Markov
  Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured
  in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system
  architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat,
  skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically
  recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds
  to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014,
  XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in
  establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of
  large-scale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23,
  which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human
  conversations.</td>
