  width:1406pt'>Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular due to their
  benefits in saving costs, time, and effort. This is due to the fact that they
  allow users to communicate and control different services easily through
  natural language. Chatbot development requires special expertise (e.g.,
  machine learning and conversation design) that differ from the development of
  traditional software systems. At the same time, the challenges that chatbot
  developers face remain mostly unknown since most of the existing studies focus
  on proposing chatbots to perform particular tasks rather than their
  development. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the Q{\&amp;}A website,
  Stack Overflow, to provide insights on the topics that chatbot developers are
  interested and the challenges they face. In particular, we leverage topic
  modeling to understand the topics that are being discussed by chatbot
  developers on Stack Overflow. Then, we examine the popularity and difficulty
  of those topics. Our results show that most of the chatbot developers are
  using Stack Overflow to ask about implementation guidelines. We determine 12
  topics that developers discuss (e.g., Model Training) that fall into five
  main categories. Most of the posts belong to chatbot development,
  integration, and the natural language understanding (NLU) model categories.
  On the other hand, we find that developers consider the posts of building and
  integrating chatbots topics more helpful compared to other topics.
  Specifically, developers face challenges in the training of the chatbot's
  model. We believe that our study guides future research to propose techniques
  and tools to help the community at its early stages to overcome the most
  popular and difficult topics that practitioners face when developing
  chatbots.</td>

  provide teenage victims with necessary information and emotional support.
  There is a small number of counseling chatbots for victims of sexual crime,
  but none targeting teenagers specifically. This research suggests design
  guidelines for building a counseling chatbot for teenage victims of online
  sexual exploitation with a focus on establishing rapport by empathizing with
  their stories and providing them with the proper information. We conducted
  in-depth interviews with peer counselors at the Teenage Women's Human Rights
  Center, who have been consulting teenage victims in their age group using
  online messengers. The four key findings from our research suggested using
  open-ended questions, using teenager-friendly language, helping teenagers

  width:1406pt'>Nowadays, machine-based conversational systems known as
  chatbots have emerged for many applications in our lives. Chatbots are
  intelligent tools that use the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
  order to communicate with humans using their natural languages. The inherent
  role of chatbots is to understand users' questions and provide the most
  appropriate responses intelligently and naturally. Chatbots have been very
  successful in some of the most spoken languages; however, Arabic chatbots
  have not reached the expected level. Recently, many researchers have
  attempted to fill the gap in implementing Arabic chatbots trying to overcome
  the complex linguistic features of Arabic language. Although Arabic chatbots
  can be utilized as a supportive tool for Saudi university students, their
  implementation, especially in Arabic language, is surprisingly neglected.
  Moreover, during changing the mode of education into distance learning due to
  (COVID-19) pandemic, it did not help the emergence of Arabic chatbots in
  Saudi universities. This research focuses on language-related challenges and
  obstacles that hinder the implementation of Arabic chatbots. Additionally,
  this paper presents fundamental recommendations for implementing effective
  Arabic chatbots for academic uses. In summary, it is noticed that Arabic
  chatbots literature suffers from paucity, which means further studies are
  needed in this area.</td>

  drainage canal obstruction problem management. The platform is developed to
  gather the surveyed information about drainage canal obstruction problems,
  including the specialist's recommendation solution. Because of the complexity
  and more detail of the obstruction problems, the platform is designed by
  applying the user interface design guideline and uses the chatbot technology
  to support the user in successfully performing the obstruction problem management
  planning. The system usability score is used to evaluate the platform. The
  average index score is 71.75, which means the platform usability is accepted.
  This platform has been practically applied as the information system to
  support flooding management planning for local government in Chiang Mai
  province, Thailand.</td>

  width:1406pt'>IMPACT: The design of public financial management (PFM) systems
  requires the exploration of the problem space before solution options are
  generated. Case studies are often employed to teach the design of PFM
  systems, but conventional forms of delivery of case study materials fail to
  help develop the skills needed to explore the problem space. This article
  investigates the use of chatbot-assisted case studies as a way to stimulate
  students' efforts to pose questions about features of the problem scenario.
  ABSTRACT This article describes the use of a chatbot-assisted case study in
  teaching accountancy students how to design a public financial management
  system. A case study on the redesign of invoice payment system at the
  government of Andaluc{\'{i}}a in the 1980s was delivered to 18
  distance-learning postgraduate students via a chatbot that helped explore the
  problem space. Analysis of conversational interactions and students' feedback
  provides some support for the use of chatbot-assisted case studies but also
  some limitations.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol, and
  tobacco are the most available substances for managing stress and can induce
  a risk of addiction. KANOPEE is a smartphone application available to the
  general population using an embodied conversational agent (ECA) to screen for
  experiences of problems with alcohol/tobacco use and to provide follow-up
  tools for brief intervention. Objectives: This study aimed to determine if
  the smartphone KANOPEE application could identify people at risk for alcohol
  and/or tobacco use disorders in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic,
  to assess adherence to a 7-day follow-up use diary, and to evaluate trust and
  acceptance of the application. Methods: The conversational agent, named
  Jeanne, interviewed participants about perceived problems with the use of
  alcohol and tobacco since the pandemic and explored risk for tobacco and
  alcohol use disorder with the five-item Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS-5)
  and âCut Down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-openerâ (CAGE) questionnaire and
  experience of craving for each substance. Descriptive, univariate, and
  multivariate analyses were performed to specify personalized associations
  with reporting a problem with alcohol/tobacco use; descriptive analysis
  reported the experience with the intervention and acceptance and trust in the
  application. Results: From April 22 to October 26, 2020, 1,588 French
  participants completed the KANOPEE interview, and 318 answered the acceptance
  and trust scales. Forty-two percent of tobacco users and 27{\%} of alcohol
  users reported problem use since the pandemic. Positive screening with CDS-5
  and CAGE and craving were associated with reported problem use (p {\textless}
  0.0001). Lockdown period influenced alcohol (p {\textless} 0.0005) but not
  tobacco use (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Eighty-eight percent of users reported
  that KANOPEE was easy to use, and 82{\%} found Jeanne to be trustworthy and
  credible. Conclusion: KANOPEE was able to screen for risk factors for
  substance use disorder (SUD) and was acceptable to users. Reporting craving
  and being at risk for SUD seem to be early markers to be identified. Alcohol
  problem use seems to be more reliant on contextual conditions such as
  confinement. This method is able to offer acceptable, brief, and early
  intervention with minimal delay for vulnerable people.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Bangladesh is home to 160 million people and is the most
  densely populated country in the world. Once, this country was dependent only
  on agriculture. But with the change of time, the advent of advanced
  technology has taken place in every field of this country. Now Bangladesh
  is&nbsp;being transformed into a modern technology-based country. Automation
  and control technology is being applied in various industries. Artificial
  Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Blockchain, etc. have
  become very popular in Bangladesh. Although late, the impact of these
  technologies has begun to be felt in different sectors of the country. For
  the effective implementation of AI, several specific sectors such as
  services, transportation, education, agriculture, health, and the environment
  have been identified in Bangladesh. Overall in Bangladesh, we see extensive
  use of AI technologies, for example, ride-sharing, natural language
  processing (NLP) for Bengali, ChatBots, booking hotels, buying air tickets and
  real-time mapping, etc. As about 34{\%} of youth are technology-driven in the
  country now, the successful integration of AI technologies will lead
  Bangladesh towards a prosperous future. For implementing AI technology, the
  government of Bangladesh should have to undertake huge preparation. So there
  will be many challenges if the technology is adopted without any proper
  preparation. This challenge is not only for Bangladesh to adopting&nbsp;AI,
  every country has to go through these issues. So the Bangladesh government
  needs to have preparation such as infrastructural development and technology
  enhancement and some other relevant issues to control the AI. This chapter
  briefly discusses the current technological situations in Bangladesh along
  with the concept of AI, its applications in different sectors, and the
  relevant challenges. The chapter also suggests the steps to be taken in the
  use of AI technology to maintain certain aspects such as policy, information
  privacy, security, and regulations.</td>

  agents (chatbots) that deliver psychological therapies is under-researched.
  Objective: This study aimed to compare the system usability, acceptability,
  and effectiveness in older adults of 2 Web-based conversational agents that
  differ in theoretical orientation and approach. Methods: In a randomized
  study, 112 older adults were allocated to 1 of the following 2 fully
  automated interventions: Manage Your Life Online (MYLO; ie, a chatbot that mimics
  a therapist using a method of levels approach) and ELIZA (a chatbot that
  mimics a therapist using a humanistic counseling approach). The primary
  outcome was problem distress and resolution, with secondary outcome measures
  of system usability and clinical outcome. Results: MYLO participants spent
  significantly longer interacting with the conversational agent. Posthoc tests
  indicated that MYLO participants had significantly lower problem distress at
  follow-up. There were no differences between MYLO and ELIZA in terms of
  problem resolution. MYLO was rated as significantly more helpful and likely
  to be used again. System usability of both the conversational agents was
  associated with helpfulness of the agents and the willingness of the
  participants to reuse. Adherence was high. A total of 12{\%} (7/59) of the
  MYLO group did not carry out their conversation with the chatbot.
  Conclusions: Controlled studies of chatbots need to be conducted in clinical
  populations across different age groups. The potential integration of
  chatbots into psychological care in routine services is discussed.</td>

  unique challenges for DHH users? In this work, we aim to answer these
  questions by conducting 4 in-depth interviews, as well as collecting survey
  data from 73 DHH individuals. Our findings show that individuals, even with
  profound deafness, can leverage SAs to accomplish complex daily tasks.
  However, we also identified a number of common challenges DHH individuals face
  when interacting with SAs (e.g., high pitch used in the default SA voice
  interfaces can be incompatible with hearing aids, difficulty using mobile SAs
  in public places with loud background noise). Based on these insights, we
  provide a set of suggestions for designing SAs that can better accommodate a
  wide range of hearing abilities. Specifically, SAs should provide more
  customization options to allow the user to tailor their SA to meet their
  hearing needs over time. For example, using a pitch-frequency test feature,
  much like audiograms conducted by audiologists, could allow users to
  calibrate their SA's voice to fit within their optimal range. We also see a
  need to provide more clear and actionable error messages conveyed beyond
  audio notifications, such as more meaningful light notifications these
  recommendations and findings provide the first step forward toward a more

  electronic medical records, are gaining momentum across all medical
  disciplines, and their adoption has been accelerated, in part, by the
  COVID-19 pandemic. Personal wearables, sensors, and mobile technologies are
  increasingly being used to identify health risks and assist in diagnosis,
  treatment, and monitoring of health and disease. Genomics is a vanguard of
  digital healthcare as we witness a convergence of the fields of genomic and
  digital medicine. Spurred by the acute need to increase health literacy,
  empower patients' preference-sensitive decisions, or integrate vast amounts
  of complex genomic data into the clinical workflow, there has been an
  emergence of digital support tools in genomics-enabled care. We present three
  use cases that demonstrate the application of these converging technologies:
  digital genomics decision support tools, conversational chatbots to scale the
  genetic counseling process, and the digital delivery of comprehensive genetic
  services. These digital solutions are important to facilitate
  patient-centered care delivery, improve patient outcomes, and increase
  healthcare efficiencies in genomic medicine. Yet the development of these
  innovative digital genomic technologies also reveals strategic challenges
  that need to be addressed before genomic digital health can be broadly
  adopted. Alongside key evidentiary gaps in clinical and cost-effectiveness,
  there is a paucity of clinical guidelines, policy, and regulatory frameworks
  that incorporate digital health. We propose a research agenda, guided by
  learning healthcare systems, to realize the vision of digital health-enabled
  genomics to ensure its sustainable and equitable deployment in clinical care.</td>

  challenging tasks in natural language processing, and it is especially hard
  in the case of open-domain dialogue. The main factors that hinder progress in
  this area are lack of training data and difficulty of automatic evaluation.
  Thus, to reliably evaluate the quality of such models, one needs to resort to
  time-consuming and expensive human evaluation. We tackle these problems by
  organizing the Conversational Intelligence Challenge (ConvAI) â open
  competition of dialogue systems. Our goals are threefold: to work out a good
  design for human evaluation of open-domain dialogue, to grow open-source code
  base for conversational systems, and to harvest and publish new datasets.
  Over the course of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions, we developed a framework
  for evaluation of chatbots in messaging platforms and used it to evaluate
  over 30 dialogue systems in two conversational tasks â discussion of short
  text snippets from Wikipedia and personalized small talk. These large-scale
  evaluation experiments were performed by recruiting volunteers as well as
  paid workers. As a result, we succeeded in collecting a dataset of around
  5,000 long meaningful human-to-bot dialogues and got many insights into the
  organization of human evaluation. This dataset can be used to train an
  automatic evaluation model or to improve the quality of dialogue systems. Our
  analysis of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions shows that the future work in
  this area should be centered around the more active participation of
  volunteers in the assessment of dialogue systems. To achieve that, we plan to
  make the evaluation setup more engaging.</td>

  literature concerning artificial intelligence-assisted psychosis risk
  screening in adolescents. In terms of the practice of psychosis risk
  screening, the application of two artificial intelligence-assisted screening
  methods, chatbot and large-scale social media data analysis, is summarized in
  detail. Regarding the challenges of psychiatric risk screening, ethical issues
  constitute the first challenge of psychiatric risk screening through
  artificial intelligence, which must comply with the four biomedical ethical
  principles of respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and
  impartiality such that the development of artificial intelligence can meet
  the moral and ethical requirements of human beings. By reviewing the
  pertinent literature concerning current artificial intelligence-assisted
  adolescent psychosis risk screens, we propose that assuming they meet ethical
  requirements, there are three directions worth considering in the future
  development of artificial intelligenceassisted psychosis risk screening in
  adolescents as follows: nonperceptual realtime artificial
  intelligence-assisted screening, further reducing the cost of artificial
  intelligence-assisted screening, and improving the ease of use of artificial

  width:1406pt'>Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots are changing the
  nature of service interfaces from being human-driven to technology-dominant.
  As a result, customers are expected to resolve issues themselves before
  reaching out to customer service representatives, ultimately becoming a
  central element of service production as co-creators of value. However,
  AI-powered interactions can also fail, potentially leading to anger,
  confusion, and customer dissatisfaction. We draw on the value co-creation
  literature to investigate the process of co-destruction in AI-powered service
  interactions. We adopt an exploratory approach based on in-depth interviews
  with 27 customers who have interacted with AI-powered chatbots in customer
  service settings. We find five antecedents of failed interactions between
  customers and chatbots: authenticity issues, cognition challenges, affective
  issues, functionality issues, and integration conflicts. We observe that
  although customers do accept part of the responsibility for co-destruction,
  they largely attribute the problems they experience to resource
  misintegration by service providers. Our findings contribute a better
  understanding of value co-destruction in AI-powered service settings and
  provide a richer conceptualization of the link between customer resource
  loss, attributions of resource loss, and subsequent customer coping
  strategies. Our findings also offer service managers insights into how to
  avoid and mitigate value co-destruction in AI service settings.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Extant literature has predominantly viewed value co-creation as
  a voluntary process of value creation between the customer and the service
  provider (e.g., Grissemann and Stokburger-Sauer 2012; Sugathan, Ranjan, and
  Mulky 2017). However, the customer may not always enter into the value
  co-creation process voluntarily. As chatbots are increasingly replacing
  traditional customer service options (Belanche et al. 2020), customers may
  find themselves in situations where they are forced to use automated technologies
  (Reinders, Frambach, and Kleijnen 2015). Indeed, several service providers
  have started to offer chatbots as the only customer solution, especially as
  the first point of contact for customer service queries (Forrester 2017).
  Such cases, where the customer does not have a choice as to whether to
  interact with a chatbot or a human representative, represent instances of
  mandatory customer participation (Dong and Sivakumar 2017; Tsai, Wu, and
  Huang 2017). Limiting consumers' perceived freedom of choice in co-creating,
  may result in severe negative attitudes towards the evaluation of the
  technology and the service provider (Reinders, Dabholkar, and Frambach 2008).
  Such attitudes may be further exacerbated when a situation requiring the
  forced use of a technology leads to service failure. We argue that in cases
  of service failure, forced co-creation (no choice but to interact with
  chatbot) will have a distinct impact on customer responsibility attributions
  of controllability, stability and locus of causality, when compared to
  voluntary co-creation (choice between chatbot and human representative). We
  also investigate the role of customer expectations and propose that
  expectations mediate the relationship between each co-creation setting and
  the resulting responsibility attributions. Experimental research is being
  proposed to test the research framework in a customer service setting, taking
  into consideration two types of service failure: outcome and process failure.
  Participants will be randomly assigned to two different co-creation settings:
  forced co-creation and co-creation by choice, and will be required to
  interact with an actual chatbot, which has been programmed using the IBM
  Watson platform. Participant responses will be recorded through an online
  questionnaire. The findings of this experimental research are expected to
  contribute to a more insightful understanding of the consequences of forcing
  consumers to use novel technologies. This is an important research area which
  has been largely overlooked in service literature to date, as the literature
  has typically examined the introduction of new technologies within a
  voluntary context. Insights into these behaviours are also important to
  achieve a more substantive understanding of the implications of AI
  technologies, and to find ways to reduce negative reactions to such
  technologies.</td>

  Objective: The development of chatbot prevention for eating disorders (EDs)
  is still in its infancy. Our aim is to present examples of and solutions to
  challenges in designing and refining a rule-based prevention chatbot program
  for EDs, targeted at adult women at risk for developing an ED. Methods:
  Participants were 2409 individuals who at least began to use an EDs
  prevention chatbot in response to social media advertising. Over 6 months,
  the research team reviewed up to 52,129 comments from these users to identify
  inappropriate responses that negatively impacted users' experience and
  technical glitches. Problems identified by reviewers were then presented to
  the entire research team, who then generated possible solutions and
  implemented new responses. Results: The most common problem with the chatbot
  was a general limitation in understanding and responding appropriately to
  unanticipated user responses. We developed several workarounds to limit these
  problems while retaining some interactivity. Conclusions: Rule-based chatbots
  have the potential to reach large populations at low cost but are limited in
  understanding and responding appropriately to unanticipated user responses.
  They can be most effective in providing information and simple conversations.
  Workarounds can reduce conversation errors.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Background: Recent advances in natural language processing and
  artificial intelligence have led to widespread adoption of speech recognition
  technologies. In consumer health applications, speech recognition is usually
  applied to support interactions with conversational agents for data
  collection, decision support, and patient monitoring. However, little is
  known about the use of speech recognition in consumer health applications and
  few studies have evaluated the efficacy of conversational agents in the hands
  of consumers. In other consumer-facing tools, cognitive load has been
  observed to be an important factor affecting the use of speech recognition
  technologies in tasks involving problem solving and recall. Users find it
  more difficult to think and speak at the same time when compared to typing,
  pointing, and clicking. However, the effects of speech recognition on
  cognitive load when performing health tasks has not yet been explored.
  Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of speech
  recognition for documentation in consumer digital health tasks involving
  problem solving and recall. Methods: Fifty university staff and students were
  recruited to undertake four documentation tasks with a simulated
  conversational agent in a computer laboratory. The tasks varied in complexity
  determined by the amount of problem solving and recall required (simple and
  complex) and the input modality (speech recognition vs keyboard and mouse).
  Cognitive load, task completion time, error rate, and usability were
  measured. Results: Compared to using a keyboard and mouse, speech recognition
  significantly increased the cognitive load for complex tasks (Z=-4.08,
  P{\textless}.001) and simple tasks (Z=-2.24, P=.03). Complex tasks took
  significantly longer to complete (Z=-2.52, P=.01) and speech recognition was
  found to be overall less usable than a keyboard and mouse (Z=-3.30, P=.001).
  However, there was no effect on errors. Conclusions: Use of a keyboard and
  mouse was preferable to speech recognition for complex tasks involving
  problem solving and recall. Further studies using a broader variety of
  consumer digital health tasks of varying complexity are needed to investigate
  the contexts in which use of speech recognition is most appropriate. The
  effects of cognitive load on task performance and its significance also need
  to be investigated.</td>

  In this paper, we focus on a specific type of dialogue systems: Time-Offset
  Interaction Applications (TOIAs) are intelligent, conversational software

  a novel dataset that identifies multiple good answers to specific TOIA
  questions through the help of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. This âview from
  the crowd' allows us to study the variations of how TOIA interrogators
  perceive its answers. Our contributions include the annotated dataset that we
  make publicly available and the proposal of Success Rate @k as an evaluation
  metric that is more appropriate than the traditional QA's and information

  (or conversational agents) including voice control interfaces, personal
  digital assistants and chatbots are examples of industrial applications
  developed to interact with customers in a human-like way using natural
  language. With continued growth in messaging applications and increasing
  demand for machine-based communications, conversational chatbot is likely to
  play a large part in companies' customer experience strategy. As systems
  designed for personalized interaction with users, conversational chatbots are
  becoming increasingly sophisticated in an attempt to mimic human dialogue.
  However, building an intelligent chatbot is challenging as it requires spoken
  language understanding, dialogue context awareness and human-like aspects
  demonstration. In this paper, we present the results of data-driven chatbot
  implementation in order to better understand the challenges of building an
  intelligent agent capable of replying to users with coherent and engaging
  responses in conversation. Developed chatbot demonstrates the balance between
  domain-specific responding and users' need for a comprehensive dialogue
  experience. The retrieval-based model, which achieved the best dialogue
  performance, is proposed. Furthermore, we present the datasets collected for

  Given its potential in supporting long-term human-agent relationships, it is
  paramount that HCI focuses eforts on delivering this promise. We aim to
  understand what people value in conversation and how this should manifest in
  agents. Findings from a series of semi-structured interviews show people make
  a clear dichotomy between social and functional roles of conversation,
  emphasising the long-term dynamics of bond and trust along with the
  importance of context and relationship stage in the types of conversations
  they have. People fundamentally questioned the need for bond and common

  years, AI has made big inroads in Food {\&amp;} Beverage service industry has
  helped food processors come up with innovative ways to not just process but
  also in packaging and even delivering the finished product to the customer.
  This research will try and ascertain the various ways the Food and Beverage
  industry has reacted to the introduction of Artificial Intelligence. From
  food production to food processing, the food industry is witnessing a major
  shift in the ways it deals with customers and other businesses. The present
  study attempts to explain various facets of the prevalent artificial
  intelligence that are appropriate for hospitality-related activities. This
  will help one to understand that if the power of artificial intelligence can
  be used in restaurants. This exploratory study analyses the secondary data
  and different literature accessible in research. AI has been successfully
  used in many sections in restaurants such as recommendation and suggestion engine,
  chatbot, robot, kiosks, integrated purchasing and inventory, biometrics etc.
  It is not only meeting with the increased demand and pace of Artificial
  Intelligence but also helping reshape the Food and Beverage industry and
  customer behavior. Undoubtedly, the application of Artificial Intelligence
  has continuously boosted the industry but still many people are unaware of
  the potentials that it posses.</td>

  Discussion: The ability of our current healthcare system to cope with the
  current situation is mainly dependent on advanced health technology, such as
  telehealth, chatbots, virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI).
  Telehealth can be a novel tool for improving our current healthcare system
  and allowing for greater delivery of healthcare services during global crises
  (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic). Technology, such as chatbots, VR, and AI,
  could be utilized to reduce the burden of both communicable and
  noncommunicable diseases, as well as to build a patient-centered
  decision-making healthcare system. Objectives: Understanding the various
  methods of enhancing healthcare services using advanced health technology
  will help to develop new applications that can be integrated into regular
  healthcare and in time of healthcare crises. Conclusion: Advanced health technology

  response. In the healthcare domain, such chatbot based systems gain in
  interest since they promise to increase adherence to electronically delivered

  patients is scarce due to time constraints and logistical reasons which
  impacts on patient knowledgeability and satisfaction, but also on examination
  and diagnostic quality. Objective: We illuminate medical history interviews
  from a radiologist's perspective and discuss its impact on the diagnostic
  quality. Based on these insights, we develop a digital medical interview
  assistant (DMIA) for radiology that is intended to collect information helping
  in improving radiological diagnostics. Methods: Conditions, issues, problems
  in the radiological examination process are assessed to collect requirements
  and to specify questions for a digital medical history interview. Results: A
  DMIA with conversational user interface is developed using the scripting
  language RiveScript. It is accessible through a social media messenger
  (Telegram messenger). An initial assessment of usability demonstrates a good
  usability. Conclusion: To overcome the information gap in radiology, a DMIA
  can simulate an assessment interview. It is still necessary to remove
  existing barriers in interaction with the DMIA for example by facilitating
  data entry options.</td>

  width:1406pt'>In an era of unstructured data abundance, you would think that
  we have solved our data requirements for building robust systems for language
  processing. However, this is not the case if we think on a global scale with
  over 7000 languages where only a handful have digital resources. Systems at
  scale with good performance typically require annotated resources that cover
  the genres and domain divides. Moreover, the existence of a handful of
  resources in some languages is a reflection of the digital disparity in
  various societies leading to inadvertent biases in systems. In this talk I
  will show some solutions for low resource scenarios, both cross domain and
  genres as well as cross lingually.I will talk about handling data paucity
  from the angle of devising principled metrics for data selection. Summarizing
  data samples by quantitative measures has a long history, with descriptive
  statistics being a case in point. However, as natural language processing
  methods flourish, there are still insufficient characteristic metrics to
  describe a collection of texts in terms of the words, sentences, or
  paragraphs they comprise. In this work, we propose metrics of diversity,
  density, and homogeneity that quantitatively measure the dispersion,
  sparsity, and uniformity of a text collection. We conduct a series of
  simulations to verify that each metric holds desired properties and resonates
  with human intuitions. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that
  the proposed characteristic metrics are highly correlated with text
  classification performance of a renowned model, BERT, which could inspire
  future applications. We specifically look at the problem of Intent
  classification (IC) as well as sentiment analysis.From the modeling side, for
  low resource scenarios for genres and domains, we investigate some techniques
  for few shot learning for the problems of intent classification (IC) and the
  sequence learning models for slot filling (SF) which are both core components
  in dialogue systems for task oriented chatbots. Current IC/SF models perform
  poorly when the number of training examples per class is small. We propose a
  new few-shot learning task, few-shot IC/SF, to study and improve the
  performance of IC and SF models on classes not seen at training time in ultra
  low resource scenarios. We establish a few-shot IC/SF benchmark. We show that
  two popular few-shot learning algorithms, model agnostic meta learning (MAML)
  and prototypical networks, outperform a fine tuning baseline on this
  benchmark.From a multilingual perspective, we bootstrap cross lingual systems
  for inducing word and sentence level representations. Most existing methods
  for automatic bilingual dictionary induction rely on prior alignments between
  the source and target languages, such as parallel corpora or seed
  dictionaries. For many language pairs, such supervised alignments are not
  readily available. We propose an unsupervised approach for learning a
  bilingual dictionary for a pair of languages given their
  independently-learned monolingual word embeddings. The proposed method
  exploits local and global structures in monolingual vector spaces to align
  them such that similar words are mapped to each other. Finally, I will show
  you how we use projection for cross lingual emotion detection and semantic
  role labeling. We leverage a multitask learning framework coupled with an
  annotation projection method from a rich-resource language to a low-resource
  language through parallel data, and train a predictive models using the
  projected data.</td>

  for specific subgroups such as those with life-long intellectual disabilities

  doing so, we hope to inform future research as well as practical decision-making
  in the context of CAs as potential quality of life enhancers for older adults

  search was conducted in form of a&nbsp;scoping review. A&nbsp;total of 841
  publications were screened for benefits and challenges of CAs, resulting in
  an extraction of 18&nbsp;articles targeting healthy aging older adults
  (60&nbsp;years+) and 5&nbsp;articles targeting older adults with ID
  (50&nbsp;years+) for synthesis. Results: The existing evidence suggests that
  CAs come with more benefits than challenges, e.g., general ease of use,
  easier information access, and feelings of companionship. Higher perceived
  agency due to using a&nbsp;CA seems to be a&nbsp;specific issue for older

  financial technologies fail to leverage the full potential of AI. Drawing on
  existing literature, this paper elaborates on the opportunities and risks associated
  with AI in the financial sector. This paper makes two key contributions:
  First, we discover the present challenges in literature to demonstrate the
  need for explainable AI. Second, we reveal the lack of guidance for applying
  explainable AI in financial technologies. We derive recommendations for
  re-search, policy, and practice and argue for the increased elaboration of

  public broadcasters are testing and experimenting with these technologies to
  raise their services to the new standards of the audiovisual ecosystem. From
  algorithms that help recommend the most suitable content for users, to others
  that detect news and automate some of the tasks of journalists, these tools
  are increasingly present in public audiovisual corporations. The data were
  obtained from semi-structured in-depth interviews with a convenience sample

  automatic creation of content from structured data, the improvement of
  audience interaction through chatbots, and personalisation or verification.
  The implementation of these technologies also poses major challenges.
  Firstly, the economic cost of adapting these systems to each corporation and
  the difficulties in hiring experts to develop AI solutions prevent a complete
  deployment of these tools in public broadcasters. As main conclusions, we
  have understood that AI as a âcultureâ is believed to be vital for the public

  from being a standard and generally does not occupy a relevant strategic

  width:1406pt'>BACKGROUND The use of conversational agent interventions
  (including chatbots and robots) in mental health is growing at a fast pace.
  Recent existing reviews have focused exclusively on a subset of embodied
  conversational agent interventions despite other modalities aiming to achieve
  the common goal of improved mental health. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to
  review the use of conversational agent interventions in the treatment of
  mental health problems. METHODS We performed a systematic search using
  relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane
  library). Studies that reported on an autonomous conversational agent that
  simulated conversation and reported on a mental health outcome were included.
  RESULTS A total of 13 studies were included in the review. Among them, 4
  full-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The rest were
  feasibility, pilot RCTs and quasi-experimental studies. Interventions were
  diverse in design and targeted a range of mental health problems using a wide
  variety of therapeutic orientations. All included studies reported reductions
  in psychological distress postintervention. Furthermore, 5 controlled studies
  demonstrated significant reductions in psychological distress compared with
  inactive control groups. In addition, 3 controlled studies comparing
  interventions with active control groups failed to demonstrate superior
  effects. Broader utility in promoting well-being in nonclinical populations
  was unclear. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy and acceptability of conversational
  agent interventions for mental health problems are promising. However, a more
  robust experimental design is required to demonstrate efficacy and
  efficiency. A focus on streamlining interventions, demonstrating equivalence
  to other treatment modalities, and elucidating mechanisms of action has the
  potential to increase acceptance by users and clinicians and maximize reach.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Who wants to be immortal? While this rhetorical question seems
  to haunt humans, digital immortality is already a reality. Social networks
  have allowed and facilitated our digital footprints to remain forever at
  reach of Internet users. We will all die, on the other hand, our digital self
  may remain forever. Social media technology has also allowed people to browse
  or even post messages to maintain the memory of a person alive. It seems
  spooky, but it is technically feasible to build a chatbot from a deceased
  person's digital legacy allowing a certain degree of presence of a deceased.
  This unaware digital immortality brings new cultural, technical, social,
  ethical, and legal challenges and implications that should be brought to
  light and discussed. There is an urge to recognize the limits for an adequate
  use of digital immortality. By means of an overview, this paper reports our
  literature survey where we identified some key issues regarding digital
  immortality, looking at the benefits, consequences and complications from its
  use. Our study identified differences when dealing with famous versus
  non-famous deceased, explicitly defined public versus private data, right and
  duties related to data preservation versus deletion, technological advances
  versus restrictions, cultural impedance, and differences from the reasons for
  desiring immortalization. With this article, we aim to encourage discussions
  on digital immortality, its current limits and points that need to be
  considered regarding such a sensitive theme that is already a current issue.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) has many uses
  ranging from chatbots and virtual assistants to real-time guidance for human
  agents in contact centers. At a high level, the systems employ several
  technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning
  (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition
  (ASR). To gain insights into the contents of a conversation, both high-level
  and fine-grain analysis of language structure and components is performed before
  fusion techniques are applied. ASR has a come a long way since it became
  commercially viable in the 1990âs. The availability of several fully featured
  open source ASR systems was a catalyst for widespread adoption in commercial
  systems over the past decade. Foremost in that surge has been an open source
  package named Kaldi (https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi). More recently, the
  availability of deep learning based end-to-end neural toolkits has further
  boosted accuracy and accelerated adoption. This same trend has been observed
  with respect to NLP. Deep learning methods, including a powerful encoder
  decoder architecture known as a Transformer, have paved the way for highly
  accurate language analysis including entity extraction, sentiment analysis,
  coreference resolution and summarization. However, traditional approaches to
  NLP, are also still important when there is insufficient data for training
  these complex neural systems. In this talk, we will review various aspects of
  state of the art CAI systems, discuss the challenges current technology
  faces, and introduce some approaches to overcome these limitations. We will
  discuss some challenges specific to commercial implementations that require
  domain specificity and are constrained by a lack of data. Specific challenges
  that will be discussed include data curation, modelling, optimization,
  service delivery and customer success.</td>

  psychological problems. Such disorders can pose a serious threat to the
  learning and educational process of the students. In this article we present
  an intelligent Android system that can help students with such disorders or
  the psychotherapists that are treating them. The implemented technique is
  based on Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing-a recent developed
  technique in psychology. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such system
  reported in the existing literature. We are the first to report it. The
  system can have also an educational role, for example, for the students in
  psychology. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a
  psychotherapy treatment designed to cure distress associated with traumatic
  events and the memories associated with them. Through EMDR the subject must
  keep his attention on two things, the traumatic event that remained in his
  memory and a rhythmic bilateral stimulation. This process induces some
  changes and can stimulate brain areas associated with information processing.
  The purpose of this technique is to access the traumatic memory network in
  order to facilitate a new association between the traumatic event and more
  adaptive information about the event. After a successful treatment distress
  is relieved, negative thoughts are reinterpreted and physiological arousal is
  reduced. During the therapy, the client is encouraged to relive, throughout
  memories, his emotionally disturbing material while focusing on external
  stimuli like: directed lateral eye movement, hand-tapping or audio sounds.
  The implications of this procedure are multiple and can be applied both in
  the field of mental health and education.Our implementation consists of an AI
  personal assistant who performs EMDR in the form of an Android application.
  The project has multiple features such as a trained chatbot connected with a
  speech-to-text engine, an audio EMDR headset,</td>

  offered as off-the-shelf components. While there are prominent examples in
  the service sector, other sectors such as the manufacturing and process industries
  have nothing comparable. We investigate the practical challenges of building
  a virtual assistant using a representative and simplified case from of
  knowledge retrieval domain. A qualitative study reveals two significant
  obstacles: Firstly, while systems can be tuned to tackle the most relevant
  types of question tasks, user acceptance is lower than for comparable
  GUI-based systems and, secondly, a disproportional amount of effort to get
  all details and having a robust system. Overall, implementing a virtual
  assistant for an industrial application is technically feasible yet requires
  significant effort and understanding of the target audience.</td>

  Revitalization: Still Behind the Digital Curve or Catching Up?â The
  objectives of this special issue are threefold. First, to develop an
  analytical framework that can help researchers assess the role that internal
  and external factors play in mediating the nature and scope of union
  experimentation with new information and communication technologies (ICTs)
  and its contribution to the outcomes of revitalisation. Second, to present
  methods and concepts that are new to this area of research. Third, to
  generate empirical insight into how the various actors that constitute the
  trade union movement (e.g. worker councils, union confederations, trade
  unions, and union-led coalitions) can and are using the internet, social
  media and artificial intelligence as a means of revitalisation. Taken
  together the geographical scope of the articles range from single-country
  cases studies in Germany, the UK and Canada, to a cross-national case study
  in Australia and the USA, and a comparative study across Europe. In terms of
  ICTs, attention is given to websites, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and an AI
  chatbot.</td>

  of fourteen regional burns services in England and Wales each year. Families
  often have to travel long distances and may not have access to specialist
  care with restricted services due to Covid-19. This quality improvement
  project aimed to: 1) Determine national practice in paediatric burn follow up
  2) Investigate whether chatbots have been used in outpatient settings 3)
  Develop a novel application (a chatbot) that patients and parents can interact
  with for advice and reassurance following paediatric burns. Method(s): We
  conducted a national service evaluation of children's burns services in
  England and Wales. We then conducted a PRISMA compliant systematic review up
  to September 2020 to identify studies reporting chatbot use to deliver
  outpatient care. A chatbot was then developed using Dialogflow to identify
  complications and provide advice to families. Result(s): Across England and
  Wales, 11 children's burns services reported outpatient practice: six
  services follow up all children at three months, three have variable
  follow-up and two discharge all patients. Our systematic review identified 10
  studies reporting chatbot use although none were used following burns. A
  frame-based system-focused chatbot was developed in conjunction with expert
  burns surgeons and patient representatives. Conclusion(s): Chatbots are
  effective and acceptable alternatives for inperson follow up. We demonstrate
  national variation in the provision of outpatient paediatric burn care and
  have developed a chatbot that can address clinical concerns and provide
  reassurance to patients and family members. Future studies will determine the
  acceptability and safety of this chatbot.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Emotional disorders are the most common mental disorders
  globally. Psychological treatments have been found to be useful for a
  significant number of cases, but up to 40{\%} of patients do not respond to
  psychotherapy as expected. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods might enhance
  psychotherapy by providing therapists and patients with real-or close to
  real-time recommendations according to the patient's response to treatment.
  The goal of this investigation is to systematically review the evidence on
  the use of AI-based methods to enhance outcomes in psychological
  interventions in real-time or close to real-time. The search included studies
  indexed in the electronic databases Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, and
  Cochrane Library. The terms used for the electronic search included
  variations of the words âpsychotherapyâ, âartificial intelligenceâ, and
  âemotional disordersâ. From the 85 full texts assessed, only 10 studies met
  our eligibility criteria. In these, the most frequently used AI technique was
  conversational AI agents, which are chatbots based on software that can be
  accessed online with a computer or a smartphone. Overall, the reviewed
  investigations indicated significant positive consequences of using AI to
  enhance psychotherapy and reduce clinical symptomatology. Additionally, most
  studies reported high satisfaction, engagement, and retention rates when
  implementing AI to enhance psychotherapy in real-or close to real-time.
  Despite the potential of AI to make interventions more flexible and tailored
  to patients' needs, more methodologically robust studies are needed.</td>

  medical care system. But, identifying the best medicine is still an issue for
  a particular disease. Advance medical technology has resolved the issue of
  the healthcare problem. Bio-medical remains a key challenge in
  healthcare-related issues. Modern biomedical research collected data from
  e-health records, medical imaging, sensor, and text data which are
  complicated and not in structure. Only collecting data is not the solution to
  solving the health-related issue. This data enhances the learning about
  health of human and common diseases. Deep learning (DL) is a fast-growing
  field of machine learning which helps to manage a large amount of data.
  Presently, we stand at the origination of revolution in medical healthcare.
  Mostly, medication is still depending upon the symptoms and trial remedies in
  spite of all available scientific knowledge; it is not suitable to all patients
  but few of them gets relief, minimizes difficulties, and makes better chance
  of survival. It is crucial to understand the relationship between diseases to
  bring new perceptions into taxonomy of diseases. This chapter mainly focuses
  on issues and challenges that occur in medical healthcare. Further, this
  chapter also discussed some medical health issues problem such as cancer,
  tumor, breast cancer, Alzheimer, and many more diseases with the role of DL.</td>

  for sharing information which may or may not be credible. Due to this many
  incidents have occurred that show how false news can have detrimental effect
  on the people and hence it becomes imperative to check the credibility of
  online news articles. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have also taken
  multiple initiatives in past years to check the spread of misleading content
  on their platforms. Researchers have been continuously working on providing
  solutions to tackle the issue of fake news and its implications. This paper
  focuses on the Content-Based Fake News Detection (FND) which deploys
  text-based and visual-based approaches. In the past few years, a more
  sophisticated approach i.e the Multimodal approach is being used that
  combines the features of textual and visual data. This paper highlights
  various techniques for content-based FND using Deep Learning (DL) approach.
  These deep learning models and frameworks have been analyzed in detail and
  the results depict that there is a considerable improvement in the overall
  performance when the multimodal methods are used. Also, various techniques
  that might help for improving the efficiency of the FND frameworks are also
  included as future directions. This paper also presents numerous challenges
  that a researcher may encounter while modelling a FND framework and provides
  probable solution that might be applicable to overcome these challenges.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Artificial Intelligence (AI) used in the software industry has
  experienced great success during the last years. Especially emerging and
  technology affine markets in Asia and Latin America offer great opportunities
  for new AI solutions that support the customer. Additionally, to the
  technological development, there is also a growing demand in the tourism and
  hospitality industry. As a result, software companies specialized in the
  tourism and hospitality industry have started to adopt artificial intelligence
  in many different forms in their products. Especially in the tourism
  industry, customers require personalized service and are also highly
  emotional. As a consequence, the industry lives or dies on excellent service.
  Furthermore, there is a high pressure on prices, AI and automatization can
  help to offer tourism products and services for reasonable costs. However, AI
  software systems have become more and more complicated and society's
  expectations regarding the capabilities and intelligence of such systems are
  also growing. That results in higher costs, higher difficulty levels and
  higher computational requirements tourism software companies have to cope
  with. For these reasons, the main goal of this research is to find sectors
  within the tourism industry in which AI software solutions are helpful for
  the travelers' experience and also reasonable in efforts and costs for
  tourism software technology providers within a defined time horizon of 5
  years. To get an impression of future developments, various foresight methods
  such as the Delphi method and a structural analysis were used. This paper
  elaborates on the practical opportunities and challenges to be faced by
  tourism software companies when developing AI software solutions and provides
  recommendations on how to deal with these challenges. The analysis shows that
  major improvements because of AI can be implemented in online travel agencies
  (OTAs) which are considered as the most important field for application of AI
  technology. Within this sector, chatbots, individual offers, mobile apps and
  social networks as a data source will improve travelers experience which
  leads consequently to an increase in revenues. {\textcopyright} IAMOT 2019.</td>

  during speech interaction to reduce users' negative impressions of speech
  recognition systems when speech recognition fails. Speech recognition failure
  makes users uncomfortable, and the cognitive strain in rephrasing commands is
  high. The proposed method aims to eliminate users' negative impression of
  agents by allowing an agent to have multiple personalities and accept
  responsibility for the failure, with the personality responsible for failure
  being removed from the task. System hardware remains the same, and users can
  continue to interact with another personality of the agent. Shifting the
  agent's personality is represented by a change in voice tone and LED color.
  Experimental results suggested that the proposed method reduces users'
  negative impressions by improving communication between users and the agent.</td>

  <td class=xl653377 width=1875 style='border-top:none;border-left:none;
  width:1406pt'>There is a resurgent interest in developing intelligent
  open-domain dialog systems due to the availability of large amounts of
  conversational data and the recent progress on neural approaches to
  conversational AI [33]. Unlike traditional task-oriented bots, an open-domain
  dialog system aims to establish long-term connections with users by
  satisfying the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging.
  This article reviews the recent work on neural approaches that are devoted to
  addressing three challenges in developing such systems: Semantics,
  consistency, and interactiveness. Semantics requires a dialog system to not
  only understand the content of the dialog but also identify users' emotional
  and social needs during the conversation. Consistency requires the system to
  demonstrate a consistent personality to win users' trust and gain their
  long-term confidence. Interactiveness refers to the system's ability to
  generate interpersonal responses to achieve particular social goals such as
  entertainment and conforming. The studies we select to present in this survey
  are based on our unique views and are by no means complete. Nevertheless, we
  hope that the discussion will inspire new research in developing more
  intelligent open-domain dialog systems.</td>

  Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journals by searching the Web of Science
  (WoS) database. From the analysis results, it was found that the United
  States, Taiwan and Hong Kong are the top three contributing countries or
  regions. In addition, most studies adopted quantitative methods in their
  research design, such as ANOVA (Analysis of variance), descriptive statistics,
  t test, and correlation analysis. ANCOVA (Analysis of covariance) was the
  most frequently adopted approach for comparing the performances or
  perceptions of different groups of students. From the analysis results, the
  greatest proportion of studies adopted guided learning, followed by no
  learning activities. It was determined that the studies related to chatbots
  in education are still in an early stage since there are few empirical
  studies investigating the use of effective learning designs or learning
  strategies with chatbots. This implies much room for conducting relevant
  research to drive innovative teaching in terms of improving the learning
  process and learning outcomes. Finally, we highlight the research gaps and

  deteriorating executive functions, in particular their working memory, and
  therefore find it hard to complete multistep tasks or activities of daily
  living. There is no doubt that during the pandemic, PwD and their caregivers
  were particularly vulnerable, often isolated which affected their mental and
  physical health. Their ability to live independently was hampered, fomenting
  depression in the PwD and burnout on informal caregivers. Information technology
  can support dementia care improving the quality of life of PwD and easing the
  burden on caregivers. There is an increasing demand to support informal
  caregivers and improve their well-being by making dementia challenges less
  severe. This study uses qualitative techniques to design a model with
  technological strategies based on semi-structured interviews applied to seven
  informal caregivers from two different countries. Based on these interviews
  we developed design insights for implementing solutions to help informal
  caregivers take care of their PwD at home using conversational agents. We
  hope that the findings presented in this study will help researchers, and
  developers design solutions that can support PwD and informal caregivers.</td>

  conversations with users. Entity Linking (EL) is one of the means of text
  understanding, with proven efficacy for various downstream tasks in
  information retrieval. In this paper, we study entity linking for
  conversational systems. To develop a better understanding of what EL in a
  conversational setting entails, we analyze a large number of dialogues from
  existing conversational datasets and annotate references to concepts, named
  entities, and personal entities using crowdsourcing. Based on the annotated
  dialogues, we identify the main characteristics of conversational entity
  linking. Further, we report on the performance of traditional EL systems on
  our Conversational Entity Linking dataset, ConEL, and present an extension to
  these methods to better fit the conversational setting. The resources
  released with this paper include annotated datasets, detailed descriptions of
  crowdsourcing setups, as well as the annotations produced by various EL
  systems. These new resources allow for an investigation of how the role of
  entities in conversations is different from that in documents or isolated
  short text utterances like queries and tweets, and complement existing
  conversational datasets.</td>

  shows that these tools may be improved by integrating a chatbot function that
  can provide on demand background information about the political issues. This
  new goal-oriented tool for information-seeking tasks is called a
  Conversational Agent Voting Advice Application (CAVAA). In an experimental
  study (N = 185) during the Dutch national elections of 17 March 2021, three
  CAVAA designs (a structured design with buttons, a non-structured design with
  a text field, and a semi-structured design with buttons and a text field)
  have been compared on tool evaluation measures (ease of use, usefulness, and
  playfulness), and political measures (perceived political knowledge and
  voting intention). Also, a comparison has been made between users with a high
  or a low educational level. Results show that the structured design is
  perceived to be more playful than the non-structured design. Moreover, lower
  educated users rate the structured and the semi-structured design as easier
  to use than the non-structured design. Finally, lower educated users also
  report higher levels of political knowledge after using a CAVAA than higher
  educated users. This suggests that CAVAAs can be a valuable tool to inform
  voters.</td>

  Lithuanian, Russian) were used. Two types of word embeddings (fastText and
  BERT), three types of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers (convolutional

  LSTM (BiLSTM)), different DNN architectures (shallower and deeper), and

  Conversational Search Systems (CSS) like chatbots and Virtual Personal
  Assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and
  Google Assistant, both user and device have a limited platform to communicate
  through chatting or voice. In the information-seeking process, often users do
  not know how to properly describe their information need in a machine
  understandable language. Consequently, it is hard for the assistant agent to
  predict the user's intent and yield relevant results by only relying on the

  enhanced with the benefit of CSS, which can dig deeper into the user's query

  processing, the research analyzed news and comments related to Luda and found
  that the main concern of the public on data was regarding its collection
  process and content. Based on a qualitative analysis of the literature, the
  main source of such concerns was enhanced AI literacy which was also induced
  by the complex ethical issues related to Luda.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Recently, chatbots have been deployed in health care in various
  ways such as providing educational information, and monitoring and triaging
  symptoms. However, they can be ineffective when they are designed without a
  careful consideration of the cultural context of the users, especially for
  marginalized groups. Chatbots designed without cultural understanding may
  result in loss of trust and disengagement of the user. In this paper, through
  an interview study, we attempt to understand how chatbots can be better
  designed for Black American communities within the context of COVID-19. Along
  with the interviews, we performed design activities with 18 Black Americans
  that allowed them to envision and design their own chatbot to address their
  needs and challenges during the pandemic. We report our findings on our
  participants' needs for chatbots' roles and features, and their challenges in
  using chatbots. We then present design implications for future chatbot design
  for the Black American population.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Background: Health care and well-being are 2 main
  interconnected application areas of conversational agents (CAs). There is a
  significant increase in research, development, and commercial implementations
  in this area. In parallel to the increasing interest, new challenges in
  designing and evaluating CAs have emerged. Objective: This study aims to
  identify key design, development, and evaluation challenges of CAs in health
  care and well-being research. The focus is on the very recent projects with
  their emerging challenges. Methods: A review study was conducted with 17
  invited studies, most of which were presented at the ACM (Association for
  Computing Machinery) CHI 2020 conference workshop on CAs for health and
  well-being. Eligibility criteria required the studies to involve a CA applied
  to a health or well-being project (ongoing or recently finished). The
  participating studies were asked to report on their projects' design and
  evaluation challenges. We used thematic analysis to review the studies. Results:
  The findings include a range of topics from primary care to caring for older
  adults to health coaching. We identified 4 major themes: (1) Domain
  Information and Integration, (2) User-System Interaction and Partnership, (3)
  Evaluation, and (4) Conversational Competence. Conclusions: CAs proved their
  worth during the pandemic as health screening tools, and are expected to stay
  to further support various health care domains, especially personal health
  care. Growth in investment in CAs also shows the value as a personal
  assistant. Our study shows that while some challenges are shared with other
  CA application areas, safety and privacy remain the major challenges in the
  health care and well-being domains. An increased level of collaboration
  across different institutions and entities may be a promising direction to
  address some of the major challenges that otherwise would be too complex to
  be addressed by the projects with their limited scope and budget.</td>

  several years. More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the
  fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet
  giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into
  AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the
  highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot
  projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study
  analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI adoption in the finance
  industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with
  experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results
  using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal
  AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained
  algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will
  operate without human intervention and moral concerns.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Co-speech gestures, gestures that accompany speech, play an
  important role in human communication. Automatic co-speech gesture generation
  is thus a key enabling technology for embodied conversational agents (ECAs),
  since humans expect ECAs to be capable of multi-modal communication. Research
  into gesture generation is rapidly gravitating towards data-driven methods.
  Unfortunately, individual research efforts in the field are difficult to
  compare: There are no established benchmarks, and each study tends to use its
  own dataset, motion visualisation, and evaluation methodology. To address
  this situation, we launched the GENEA Challenge, a gesture-generation
  challenge wherein participating teams built automatic gesture-generation
  systems on a common dataset, and the resulting systems were evaluated in
  parallel in a large, crowdsourced user study using the same motion-rendering
  pipeline. Since differences in evaluation outcomes between systems now are
  solely attributable to differences between the motion-generation methods,
  this enables benchmarking recent approaches against one another in order to
  get a better impression of the state of the art in the field. This paper
  reports on the purpose, design, results, and implications of our challenge.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines
  and/or robots to perform intellectual tasks like humans. AI technologies are
  widely used to support different activities in retail operations. In
  particular, retail firms have adopted chatbots to interact with consumers
  through various communication channels, including social media, live chat,
  SMS etc. In addition, chatbots have been used to support conversational
  commerce in which companies automate conversations with consumers about
  product selection and assist consumers to make informed choices throughout
  the shopping and decision-making processes. To investigate the state of the
  art of chatbots in the retail industry, this article qualitatively studies
  commercial chatbots from 40 retail firms. The study finds that chatbots
  assist consumers in completing general tasks, such as searching information,
  purchasing products, making reservations and collecting feedback. Chatbots
  are good enough to perform such general tasks, although they have limited
  capability with respect to processing and interpreting natural language.
  Chatbots also provide menus to address the most predominant issues
  encountered by consumers while running at a lower operational cost. It is
  anticipated that chatbots will gain popularity in the retail industry, and
  consumers would benefit from chatbots with improved features like more
  accurate predictions and better product recommendations.</td>

  chatbots may be utilized to assist individuals in learning more independently
  and in a variety of virtual learning contexts. The goal of this study was to
  evaluate the potential hurdles posed by the COVID-19 outbreak to online
  learning, as well as teachers' perspectives on the use of AI chatbots for
  online language learning. An online interview has been conducted with six
  interviewees in verifying the proposed questions from the teachers'
  perspectives. The result shows that there are common themes of challenges for
  online learning and online teaching: (1) Infrastructure; (2) Accessibility
  and Technology; (3) Readiness; (4) Assessment and Examinations; (5)
  Socioeconomic factors; (6) Mental health and personal well-being; (7) Online
  Security Issues and human and pet intrusions; and (8) Digital competence. The

  Memory Network and the Poly-Encoder, on the NeurIPS ConvAI2 benchmark
  dataset. Our analysis elucidates the importance of incorporating persona

  can be in high demand regardless of the usefulness of such technologies for
  specific businesses and purposes, and on the other hand, less complex and

  in humanitarian operations in order to help with the significant challenges
  the sector is facing. This article focuses on chatbots which have been
  proposed as an efficient method to improve communication with, and
  accountability to affected communities. Chatbots, together with other
  humanitarian AI applications such as biometrics, satellite imaging,
  predictive modelling and data visualisations, are often understood as part of
  the wider phenomenon of âAI for social good'. The article develops a
  decolonial critique of humanitarianism and critical algorithm studies which
  focuses on the power asymmetries underpinning both humanitarianism and AI.
  The article asks whether chatbots, as exemplars of âAI for good', reproduce
  inequalities in the global context. Drawing on a mixed methods study that
  includes interviews with seven groups of stakeholders, the analysis observes
  that humanitarian chatbots do not fulfil claims such as âintelligence'. Yet AI
  applications still have powerful consequences. Apart from the risks
  associated with misinformation and data safeguarding, chatbots reduce
  communication to its barest instrumental forms which creates disconnects
  between affected communities and aid agencies. This disconnect is compounded
  by the extraction of value from data and experimentation with untested
  technologies. By reflecting the values of their designers and by asserting
  Eurocentric values in their programmed interactions, chatbots reproduce the
  coloniality of power. The article concludes that âAI for good' is an
  âenchantment of technology' that reworks the colonial legacies of
  humanitarianism whilst also occluding the power dynamics at play.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the legal
  conditions under which governments may use green artificial intelligence (AI)
  in city planning. Although Japan was one of the early countries to release
  its general AI principles, it has been relatively slow in establishing
  conditions where administrative agencies may use AI. Granted, there have been
  some recent scholarship that discusses the usage of AI in general under
  Japanese administrative law, but the use of green AI in city planning under
  Japanese law has not yet been discussed. Hence, this paper intends to focus
  on green AI in city planning and discuss the conditions for usage based on
  different categories of AI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts
  a legal analysis on the utilization of AI for the purpose of sustainable city
  planning and administration in Japan. The approach of this paper is to
  summarize the existing scholarship in Japanese administrative law and analyse
  the new elements in the new field of green AI in city planning. This paper is
  not a natural science paper. The social science method of jurisprudence is
  used. This paper cites only public sources, and no informal literature has
  been referenced. Findings: This paper establishes the conditions where
  Japanese central and local government may use green AI in city planning from
  a legal viewpoint based on three categories. The categories are green AI
  usage in city planning concerning things, green AI usage in city planning
  concerning people and green AI usage in city planning concerning automated
  decision-making. Research limitations: This research is limited to an
  analysis of Japanese law, which means that issues other than law are not
  included in this paper. Further, although general legal issues are discussed,
  this paper is intended to discuss Japanese law issues only, and foreign laws
  are not discussed. Therefore, this paper mostly cites Japanese language
  papers published in domestic journals. Practical implications: The intended
  practical implication of this paper is to allow central and local governments
  to determine â based on the proposed categories â whether green AI can be
  used for city planning purposes and under which conditions. The authors hope
  that this will assist the Japanese government in establishing rules on the
  usage of AI by governmental agencies and allow for the greater actual usage
  by Japanese central and local governments of green AI in future city
  planning. Social implications: As the theme of this paper deals with
  governmental use (and the function of a government is to serve society), the
  social implications at issue can be said to be equivalent to the practical
  implication. Originality/value: There have been articles discussing Japanese
  administrative law restrictions on AI in general. However, as of now, to the
  best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no articles published
  focusing on green AI used for city planning. The authors note that the green
  AI used for city planning would have different legal implications from AI's
  usage by the government in general, such as the chatbot used by the agencies
  or lethal autonomous weapons by the military force. Therefore, this paper is
  original in focusing on green AI used for city planning.</td>

  single-domain of Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (HTO). Unlike
  other traditional chatbot solutions that strictly rely on intent

  provide the most relative documents and text snippets within, as the proper
  answer. To do this, we proceeded with a custom implementation based on
  Elasticsearch engine and most common NLP techniques tailored to our needs;
  i.e., tokenization, lowercase filtering, stop words removal, stemming, fuzzy
  searching, synonyms, etc. The main challenges as well as the architectural

  width:1406pt'>In game industry, natural language processing (NLP) has been
  expected to be applied to digital games, but was impossible for several
  reasons such as memory limitation, CPU resource limitation, and degree of
  maturity of NLP. However, with the advent of the Transformer architecture in
  the late 2010s and the huge amount of text resources in the Internet, NLP
  technology is rapidly advancing. Large-scale pre-trained language models, or
  foundation models, are now capable of generating sentences that are comparable
  to those of humans, and their application to creative use is being explored.
  The incorporation of NLP, especially conversation generation, into digital
  games is expected to allow users to communicate more freely with non-player
  characters (NPCs) in a fictional world. In generating the speech of the
  inhabitants of the virtual world, it is thought that considerations unique to
  digital games, apart from the ethical considerations of conversation
  generation in general, will be necessary. We have created a technical demo of
  a digital game using single-turn conversation generation and discussed issues
  for its practical application and commercialization. In this paper, we argue
  that it is necessary to consider the ethics of characters and the ethics of content
  as a whole in a hierarchical manner. For example, an entertainment story may
  include a villain who torments the protagonist. Such a villain character does
  not have a general sense of ethics. When a user converses with such a
  character, there is a concern that user will be disappointed if the
  automatically generated statements of the immoral character are morally
  correct. Entertainment sometimes requires amorality, and eliminating all
  ethically incorrect content is not always a good policy. In addition,
  inhabitants in fictional worlds may l ive u nder d ifferent ethical standards
  than those in our real world. The utterances of NPCs in such worlds should be
  based on their morals, not ours. On the other hand, the entire digital game,
  including these conversational agents, would naturally be evaluated according
  to the ethics of our world. Thus, we argue that hierarchical ethical
  considerations for the automatic generation of character utterances in
  digital games are essential for designing the digital games in the incoming
  era.</td>

  systems for fault diagnosis. When users provide ambiguous symptom
  descriptions, dialogue systems can reformulate these descriptions to check
  the correctness of their interpretation. The present study investigated
  whether such reformulations should be performed by users or dialogue systems,
  and how they should be phrased. In a Wizard-of-Oz study, subjects described
  faults symptoms to a chatbot, which subsequently asked for clarification.
  Experiment 1 compared the effects of requests for subjects to self-correct
  their descriptions and reformulations provided by the dialogue system in
  either common or technical terms. Experiment 2 combined reformulations in
  common and technical terms with each other and with pictures of fault
  symptoms. The results revealed that requests for self-correction increased
  solution times and verbal effort, that common terms decreased solution times
  but led to errors when seemingly easy reformulations were incorrect, and that
  technical terms did not mislead subjects into accepting them uncritically.
  Enrichments with pictures reduced the risk of accepting incorrect
  reformulations and were considered particularly helpful when combined with
  common terms. Lexical alignment with dialogue system reformulations was low,
  but subjects adopted its technical terms most readily when no common terms
  were provided. Taken together, the results suggest that combining
  reformulations in everyday language with visual information is most suitable
  to support grounding.</td>

  agents managing non-real conversations with consumers. It raises concerns
  about the ethical implications related to the progressive automation of
  online conversational processes and their integration with AI. The
  conversational approach has been explored in the organisational and

  conversations in managing interactions ethically. This study aims to discuss
  conceptually the ethical challenges related to chatbots within the

  learning in high-school. It is an essential trend for the modern education,
  especially building intelligent systems to support the learning of

  surveying properties of a function are popular in high-school exams. There
  are some current tools can solve them automatically. However, they only can
  display the graph of a function; they cannot solve problems about determining
  the value of a parameter to satisfy some conditions about this function's
  properties. In this paper, we will present a method to design an intelligent
  chatbot for solving problems in this knowledge domain. It plays as an
  instructor to give some tips and tutor the learner how to solve problems
  automatically. This program can communicate with the learner through the
  question-answering process by chatbot. This tutoring of our system simulates
  the tutoring method of the teacher to the students in practice.</td>

  interact with the human to tutor how to work some activities. In this work,
  we design an architecture to build an intelligent chatbot, which can tutor to
  solve problems, and construct scripts for automatically tutoring. The
  knowledge base of the intelligent tutoring chatbot is designed by using the
  requirements of an Intelligent Problem Solver. It is the combination between
  the knowledge model of relations and operators, and the structures of hint
  questions and sample problems, which are practical cases. Based on the
  knowledge base and tutoring scripts, a tutoring engine is designed. The
  tutoring chatbot plays as an instructor for solving real-world problems. It
  simulates the working of the instructor to tutor the user for solving
  problems. By utilizing the knowledge base and reasoning, the architecture of
  the intelligent chatbot are emerging to apply in the real-world. It is used
  to build an intelligent chatbot to support the learning of high-school
  mathematics and a consultant system in public administration. The

  smartphone application of diabetes coaching intervention on improving
  self-management behaviors and preventing onset diabetes complications.
  Methods: A randomized control trial, two groups, pre-test, and post-test
  design with a non-equivalent control group was conducted. The intervention
  group received a 12-week smartphone application of diabetes coaching intervention
  to improve diabetes self-management behaviors and to prevent onset diabetes
  complications. While the control group received the usual care from the
  community health centers. The smartphone application consisted of narrative
  App-based coaching, a printed user guide, mindfulness-based coaching;
  skill-based coaching, and a small App-interaction. Results: After
  implementation, the self-management behaviors among the experimental group
  were improved than the control group in terms of dietary control, physical
  exercise, blood glucose monitoring, medication adherence, and screening of
  complications. The clinical outcomes were also significantly improved among
  the experimental group and to the control group. Conclusions: A smartphone
  application-based diabetes coaching intervention was feasible to apply as a
  nationwide program to promote diabetes self-management (DSM) during the

  real robots on stage, but follows the traditional approach of having actors
  pretend that they are machines or, more specifically, projections steered by
  an artificial intelligence, so-called Primes. The play carefully avoids the
  &quot;uncanny valley&quot;(Mori) and spares the audience visceral reactions
  to the machines, instead focusing on philosophical questions about identity,
  memory, language, and humanness. The article will analyse the use of language
  as a theatrical code for machineness and explore the implications of language
  as a criterion for machineness and humanness respectively. Marjorie Prime
  will be contextualized with the Turing test, especially from the angle of

  acknowledged as a great socio-technical challenge in the last years. Despite
  advances, practical and timely solutions to properly communicate verified
  (mis)information to social media users are an evidenced need. We introduce a
  multi-agent approach to bridge Twitter users with fact-checked information.
  First, a social bot, which nudges users sharing verified misinformation, and
  a conversational agent that verifies if there is a reputable fact-check
  available and explains existing assessments in natural language. Both agents
  share the same requirements of evoking trust and being perceived by Twitter
  users as an opportunity to build their media literacy. To this end, two
  preliminary human-centred studies are presented, the first one looking for an
  adequate identity for the bot, and the second for understanding preferences
  for credibility indicators when explaining the assessment of misinformation.
  The results indicate what this design research should pursue to create agents
  that are consistent in their presentation, friendly, engaging, and credible.</td>

  intelligence systems in health care. In this paper I argue that many medical

  requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often
  handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably,
  medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise.
  Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace

  width:1406pt'>Understanding the actual intent of customers is an essential
  step in automating the conversational experience on a chat platform.
  Typically, chatbots are powered by machine learning algorithms that rely on
  the acquisition of a large amount of high quality labeled training data which
  can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this dependence on labeled
  training data, weaker forms of supervision have been recently exploited to
  generate samples in a more cost effective manner though the samples may be
  noisy. In this paper, we analyse a use-case specific to food delivery
  services where customer-agent conversations in incoherent English and
  code-mixed language (Hindi mixed with English, commonly referred to as
  Hinglish) are associated with a single customer chosen noisy label (referred
  to as &quot;Conversation Level Intent&quot;in the current paper) for the
  entire conversation. However, in reality, a conversation can have several
  messages and can be comprised of multiple labels. Moreover, each label may be
  associated with one or more messages in the conversation. In this paper, we
  demonstrate how simple light-weight word embeddings based weak supervision
  techniques can be used to tag individual customer messages with the most
  relevant label. We also show that simple augmentation techniques can
  significantly improve performance on code-mixed messages. On an internal
  benchmark dataset, we show that our sampling approach achieves an absolute
  performance gain of 33{\%} in F1 score on random sampling strategy, 19{\%} in
  F1 score over an approach using entire raw samples and 4{\%} over a Snorkel
  (a state-of-the-art weak supervision framework) based approach.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Recent research has shown feasibility of an interactive
  pair-programming conversational agent, but implementing such an agent poses
  three challenges: a lack of benchmark datasets, absence of software
  engineering specific labels, and the need to understand developer
  conversations. To address these challenges, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study
  with 14 participants pair programming with a simulated agent and collected
  4,443 developer-agent utterances. Based on this dataset, we created 26
  software engineering labels using an open coding process to develop a
  hierarchical classification scheme. To understand labeled developer-agent
  conversations, we compared the accuracy of three state-of-the-art
  transformer-based language models, BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet, which performed
  interchangeably. In order to begin creating a developer-agent dataset,
  researchers and practitioners need to conduct resource intensive Wizard of Oz
  studies. Presently, there exists vast amounts of developer-developer
  conversations on video hosting websites. To investigate the feasibility of
  using developer-developer conversations, we labeled a publicly available
  developer-developer dataset (3,436 utterances) with our hierarchical
  classification scheme and found that a BERT model trained on
  developer-developer data performed &#8764;10{\%} worse than the BERT trained
  on developer-agent data, but when using transfer-learning, accuracy improved.
  Finally, our qualitative analysis revealed that developer-developer
  conversations are more implicit, neutral, and opinionated than
  developer-agent conversations. Our results have implications for software
  engineering researchers and practitioners developing conversational agents.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Problem-solving skill is one of the soft skills that has become
  essential for employees in various organizations. Training model and
  educational technology were considered key success factors in delivering
  knowledge for personnel in the workplace to develop this skill. Problem-Based
  Learning (PBL) is a key driver for learning activities, which has been
  increasingly adopted for workplace training and has proven to be one of the
  best approaches to helping learners improve their problem-solving skills in the
  organization. Hence, this research aims to synthesize problem-based blended
  training via chatbot to enhance problem-solving skills in the workplace.
  Literature review, document analysis, and focus group technique were used as
  the main procedures for the first phase of model synthesis. The effectiveness
  of the training model was examined in the second phase by applying it to 20
  employees of the flexible lamination manufacturers in Thailand from purposive
  sampling. The training was held for four weeks and examined with a
  problem-solving skill test. In addition, a follow-up test has been conducted
  to monitor retention skills after a four-week training period. Data analysis
  used the repeated-measures ANOVA test with normality and homogeneity as a
  prerequisite test. This study shows that the problem-based blended training
  model via chatbot to enhance problem-solving skills in the workplace
  comprises six main steps: (1) Group identification; (2) Problem
  identification; (3) Idea creation; (4) Learning; (5) Implementation; (6)
  Evaluation. The results on the implemented training model showed that
  problem-solving skills after training were significantly higher than those
  before training, and the retention of skill remained higher than that before
  training and did not significantly change after finishing training at a
  statistical significance of 0.5. As a result, the developed model is highly
  appropriate for implementation, particularly because the chatbot platform is
  involved in almost every step of this training model to accommodate learners
  who can easily access the training platform, repeat the training content, and
  feel motivated to explore new information to improve their problem-solving
  skills. In a post-COVID-19 period with distancing required in the workplace,
  this model is applicable to deliver efficiency in workplace training.</td>

  advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), Conversational AI came of age in
  2010 with the launch of Apple's Siri. Conversational AI systems leveraged
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and converse with humans via
  speech and text. These systems have been deployed in sectors such as
  aviation, tourism, and healthcare. However, the application of Conversational
  AI in the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry is

  AI. Thus, this study presents a systematic review of Conversational AI in the
  AEC industry to provide insights into the current development and conducted a
  Focus Group Discussion to highlight challenges and validate areas of
  opportunities. The findings reveal that Conversational AI applications hold
  immense benefits for the AEC industry, but it is currently underexplored. The
  major challenges for the under exploration were highlighted and discusses for
  intervention. Lastly, opportunities and future research directions of
  Conversational AI are projected and validated which would improve the
  productivity and efficiency of the industry. This study presents the status
  quo of a fast-emerging research area and serves as the first attempt in the
  AEC field. Its findings would provide insights into the new field which be of
  benefit to researchers and stakeholders in the AEC industry.</td>

  leave them less able to perform on authentic problem-solving tasks from a
  lack of hands-on practice. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison of
  this trade-off in a synchronous collaborative programming project by
  adjusting the boundary between problem-solving and collaborative reflection
  based on a worked-out example while keeping the total time on task constant.
  We find that the more time students spent on worked example study, the more
  was the observed improvement in the pre-to post-test scores with no
  significant difference in performance on a subsequent problem-solving task.
  These results, therefore, challenge the dominant place of problem-solving

  systems that implement more human-like cognitive abilities. CCS are not a
  typical technological advancement but an unprecedented advance toward
  human-like systems fueled by artificial intelligence. Such systems can adapt
  to situations, perceive their environments, and interact with humans and
  other technologies. Due to these properties, CCS are already disrupting
  established industries, such as retail, insurance, and healthcare. As we make
  the case in this paper, the increasingly human-like capabilities of CCS
  challenge five fundamental assumptions that we as IS researchers have held
  about how users interact with IT artifacts. These assumptions pertain to (1)
  the direction of the userartifact relationship, (2) the artifact's awareness
  of its environment, (3) functional transparency, (4) reliability, and (5) the
  user's awareness of artifact use. We argue that the disruption of these five
  assumptions limits the applicability of our extant body of knowledge to CCS.
  Consequently, CCS present a unique opportunity for novel theory development
  and associated contributions. We argue that IS is well positioned to take
  this opportunity and present research questions that, if answered, will lead
  to interesting, influential, and original theories.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Purpose: This article reports the results from a panel
  discussion held at the 2019 European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS)
  on the use of technology-based autonomous agents in collaborative work.
  Design/methodology/approach: The panelists (Drs Izak Benbasat, Paul Benjamin
  Lowry, Stefan Morana, and Stefan Seidel) presented ideas related to affective
  and cognitive implications of using autonomous technology-based agents in
  terms of (1) emotional connection with these agents, (2) decision-making, and
  (3) knowledge and learning in settings with autonomous agents. These ideas
  provided the basis for a moderated panel discussion (the moderators were Drs
  Isabella Seeber and Lena Waizenegger), during which the initial position
  statements were elaborated on and additional issues were raised. Findings:
  Through the discussion, a set of additional issues were identified. These
  issues related to (1) the design of autonomous technology-based agents in
  terms of humanâmachine workplace configurations, as well as transparency and
  explainability, and (2) the unintended consequences of using autonomous
  technology-based agents in terms of de-evolution of social interaction,
  prioritization of machine teammates, psychological health, and biased
  algorithms. Originality/value: Key issues related to the affective and
  cognitive implications of using autonomous technology-based agents, design
  issues, and unintended consequences highlight key contemporary research
  challenges that allow researchers in this area to leverage compelling
  questions that can guide further research in this field.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Conversational agents (CAs) are frequently used in customer
  service. However, state-of-the-art CAs often fail to understand user input.
  Such failures represent trust violations and can thus stimulate negative
  word-of-mouth. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to these trust
  violations or to strategies to mitigate associated trust loss. Initial
  evidence exists that anthropomorphic design may mitigate trust loss following
  a failure in humanâcomputer interactions. From a provider's perspective, protecting
  trust is important to keep users engaged and satisfied. From a user's
  perspective, this creates ethical concerns, as anthropomorphic design may
  manipulate the assessment of the CA. Therefore, we investigated the role of
  anthropomorphic design as a trust shield. We developed a research model by
  integrating literature on trust in technology, trust repair, and
  anthropomorphic design. The results of our experimental study suggest that
  anthropomorphic design is an effective trust shield. We discuss these
  findings from theoretical, practical, and ethical perspectives.</td>

  a development of an accurate optical character recognition (OCR) system using
  convolutional neural network with deep learning algorithm, which can skip
  some steps in the workflow of manual payment approval to fasten the process
  of payment verification and confirmation. By using some machine learning
  frameworks of pyTorch utilizing Tensors and CUDA-GPU parallel computing, the
  machine learning based OCR system was developed and tested with the actual
  data. The real data sets used here cover the non-uniformity of the receipt
  bill's papers with various conditions (crumple, water drops, and folds) with
  some nature of the customer's overall camera noise, angle, and lighting.
  Several experiments associated with data preparation, deep learning parameter
  settings, and model performance comparison, were properly conducted to obtain
  a high quality of OCR system to detect trace number, approval codes, and
  nominals on the widely-used payment receipts. The resulting OCR system
  performed very satisfactory with 100{\%} accuracy on testing data set. This
  promising results permit for the integration between this accurate and

  width:1406pt'>Well before COVID-19, there was growing excitement about the
  potential of various digital technologies such as tele-health, smartphone
  apps, or AI chatbots to revolutionize mental healthcare. As the SARS-CoV-2
  virus spread across the globe, clinicians warned of the mental illness
  epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Now, funding for digital mental
  health technologies is surging and many researchers are calling for
  widespread adoption to address the mental health sequelae of COVID-19.
  Reckoning with the ethical implications of these technologies is urgent
  because decisions made today will shape the future of mental health research
  and care for the foreseeable future. We contend that the most pressing
  ethical issues concern (1) the extent to which these technologies
  demonstrably improve mental health outcomes and (2) the likelihood that
  wide-scale adoption will exacerbate the existing health inequalities laid
  bare by the pandemic. We argue that the evidence for efficacy is weak and
  that the likelihood of increasing inequalities is high. First, we review
  recent trends in digital mental health. Next, we turn to the clinical
  literature to show that many technologies proposed as a response to COVID-19
  are unlikely to improve outcomes. Then, we argue that even evidence-based
  technologies run the risk of increasing health disparities. We conclude by
  suggesting that policymakers should not allocate limited resources to the
  development of many digital mental health tools and should focus instead on
  evidence-based solutions to address mental health inequalities.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Internet-delivered intervention may be an acceptable
  alternative for the more than 90{\%} of problem gamblers who are reluctant to
  seek face-to-face support. Thus, we aimed to (1) develop a low-dropout
  unguided intervention named GAMBOT integrated with a messaging app; and (2)
  investigate its effect. The present study was a randomised, quadruple-blind,
  controlled trial. We set pre-to-post change in the Problem Gambling Severity
  Index (PGSI) as the primary outcome and pre-to-post change in the Gambling Symptom
  Assessment Scale (G-SAS) as a secondary outcome. Daily monitoring,
  personalised feedback, and private messages based on cognitive behavioural
  theory were offered to participants in the intervention group through a
  messaging app for 28&nbsp;days (GAMBOT). Participants in the control group
  received biweekly messages only for assessments for 28&nbsp;days (assessments
  only). A total of 197 problem gamblers were included in the primary analysis.
  We failed to demonstrate a significant between-group difference in the
  primary outcome (PGSI &#8722;&nbsp;1.14, 95{\%} CI &#8722;&nbsp;2.75 to 0.47,
  p = 0.162) but in the secondary outcome (G-SAS &#8722;&nbsp;3.14, 95{\%} CI
  &#8722;&nbsp;0.24 to &#8722;&nbsp;6.04, p = 0.03). Only 6.7{\%} of the
  participants dropped out during follow-up and 77{\%} of the GAMBOT group
  participants (74/96) continued to participate in the intervention throughout
  the 28-day period. Integrating intervention into a chatbot feature on a
  frequently used messaging app shows promise in helping to overcome the high
  dropout rate of unguided internet-delivered interventions. More effective and
  sophisticated contents delivered by a chatbot should be sought to engage over
  90{\%} of problem gamblers who are reluctant to seek face-to-face support.</td>

  Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills assessment and provide preliminary
  evidence from a validation pilot study. To date, educational assessments have
  focused more heavily on the concrete, and accessible aspects of CPS with a
  diminished representation of the social aspects of CPS. We addressed this
  issue through the integration of our CPS construct into the game-based
  assessment âCircuit Runnerâ in which participants interact with a virtual
  agent to solve a series of challenges in a first-person maze environment (von
  Davier, 2017). Circuit Runner provides an environment that allows for
  controlled interdependence between a user and a virtual agent that
  facilitates the demonstration of the broad range of cognitive and social
  skills required for effective CPS. Tasks are designed to incorporate
  telemetry-based (e.g., log file, clickstream, interaction-based) and item
  response data to provide a more comprehensive measure of CPS skills. Our
  study included 500 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk, who completed
  Circuit Runner, pre- and post-game surveys, and a CPS situational judgment
  test (CPS-SJT). These elements, in conjunction with the game-play, allowed
  for an expanded exploration of CPS skills with different modalities and types
  of instruments. The findings support and extend efforts to provide a stronger
  theoretical and empirical foundation for insights regarding CPS as a
  skillset, as well as the design of scalable game-based CPS assessments.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Analysis, interpretation and construction of artificial and
  natural languages as well as formalisations of communication have been
  central concerns of Artificial Intelligence since the 1950s. Current
  applications for natural language processing range from real-time translation
  of spoken language through automated discovery of sentiment in online
  postings to conversational agents embedded in everyday devices. Recent
  developments in machine learning, combined with the availability of large
  amounts of labelled training data, have enabled non-structural approaches to
  surpass classical techniques based on formal grammars, conceptual ontologies
  and symbolic representations. As the complexity and opaqueness of those
  stochastic models become more and more evident, however, the question arises
  if we trade gains in observable performance with a literal loss of
  understanding. The cyberneticâblack boxâ (Ross Ashby) re-appears as the other
  participant in the medium of communication. This development, if unchecked,
  might have fundamental ramifications for the relationship between humans and
  machines. In this article I present a distinction-based approach to propose a
  way towards a comprehensive model of communication. First, I critically
  revisit fundamental concepts traditionally observed by AI research such as
  information vs. communication, simulation vs. performance and language vs.
  cognition. I also highlight a few of the contradictory phenomena that we can
  observe today as a consequence of these choices. Then I make the case for a
  different set of distinctions. First I consult Niklas Luhmann's sociological
  theory in order to locate communication firmly within social systems as
  opposed to minds or organisms. In addition, I propose to make use of
  Friedemann Schulz von Thun's four-sided model in order to capture aspects of
  communication that are currently neglected. Finally I advocate for a
  transdisciplinary approach to explore the full context of communication
  between humans and machines.</td>

  width:1406pt'>Nowadays, new technologies are taking place for enabling
  conversational interactions between users and bots. Creating conversational
  interfaces (CI) paves the way for new design challenges. Designers need to
  use appropriate design specifications for creating a logically sound dialogue
  endowed with proper visual cues in the case of chatbots that captures the
  entire user experience. To do it they need the help of domain experts.
  Experts in mobility, environment, energy, e-health, weather, etc., are the only
  ones who well-know the specific domain in which the bot will act. Current
  tools used to design interactive flows of dialogue entail deep programming
  skills their users need to know. Starting from this consideration, the paper
  proposes a design environment that offers experts the possibility to design a
  flow of dialogue without getting lost in technicalities. By using visual
  language, the expert can specify intents, actions, entities and parameters at
  the base of the flow of dialogue on which the bot will be created. Then, our

  knowledge about available actions and their consequences is used to identify
  a sequence of actions, which, when applied in a given initial state, satisfy
  a desired goal. AI Planning has successfully been applied in a number of

  Unfortunately, these problems are often not detected in time because many
  people do not have the confidence to express their problems to doctors,
  psychologists or relevant authorities, causing them to advance to a more
  critical stage of their condition. However, many people feel more confident
  sharing their thoughts through social media platforms or chatbots these days,
  which are a form of liberation where you can lessen the social pressure to
  express your thoughts through anonymity. That is why this presented study

  creating exciting new opportunities and causing disruptions in many different
  sectors, including manufacturing, finance, insurance, and healthcare. Given
  its broad impacts across a variety of areas, smart technologies currently
  represent one of the hottest topics in both academia and industry. This
  special issue seeks to identify the latest trends and research directions on
  this topic by presenting research on the development, evaluation, management,
  and organization of smart technologies in the age of smart services. We
  identify three trending categories of smart services: (1) the Internet of
  Things and wearable technologies, (2) the sharing economy and platforms, and
  (3) intelligent agents. These innovative technologies and their corresponding
  production possibilities are of great interest to both researchers and
  practitioners, particularly in terms of their impacts under different
  application scenarios. This special issue offers a comprehensive review of
  IT-enabled smart services and we hope that it motivates further IS research
  on the theoretical and practical implications of this topic.</td>

  width:1406pt'>This paper reports on the second GENEA Challenge to benchmark
  data-driven automatic co-speech gesture generation. Participating teams used
  the same speech and motion dataset to build gesture-generation systems.
  Motion generated by all these systems was rendered to video using a
  standardised visualisation pipeline and evaluated in several large,
  crowdsourced user studies. Unlike when comparing different research papers,
  differences in results are here only due to differences between methods,
  enabling direct comparison between systems. This year's dataset was based on
  18 hours of full-body motion capture, including fingers, of different persons
  engaging in dyadic conversation. Ten teams participated in the challenge
  across two tiers: full-body and upper-body gesticulation. For each tier we
  evaluated both the human-likeness of the gesture motion and its
  appropriateness for the specific speech signal. Our evaluations decouple
  human-likeness from gesture appropriateness, which previously was a major
  challenge in the field. The evaluation results are a revolution, and a
  revelation. Some synthetic conditions are rated as significantly more
  human-like than human motion capture. To the best of our knowledge, this has
  never been shown before on a high-fidelity avatar. On the other hand, all
  synthetic motion is found to be vastly less appropriate for the speech than
  the original motion-capture recordings.</td>

  anti-bullying activity that utilizes conversational virtual agents (called
  conversation-bots or chatbots) on students' attitudes toward bullying
  problems. An experimental pre- or posttest design with a three-group setting
  was used. Eighty-nine fifth-grade students were assigned to one of three
  groups: Conversation with a virtual agent of (a) bully's role, (b) victim's
  role, and (c) teacher's role. All agents are conversation-bots designed to
  support learnerâcomputer interactions. The bully agent defends the notion
  that bullying behaviors are acceptable whereas the victim agent argues that
  bullying behavior cannot be tolerated. The teacher agent teaches students the
  types of bullying and its negative aspects. The participants completed an
  anti-bullying attitude test at pre- and posttest, which included students'
  anti-bully, intention, pro-victim, behavior, and self-efficacy factors. The
  results show that students' attitudes toward bullying problems changed to
  more positive responses after the implementation that used the
  conversation-bot. In addition, the results revealed that the agent's role had
  an impact on the students' attitudes toward the anti-bully factor.
  Implications and future research regarding the use of conversation-bots in
  education are discussed.</td>

  fields, including traditional education, where it typically showed positive
  outcomes on students' behavior and performance. In online learning
  environments, the issue of a high dropout rate is a common and serious
  concern. In this article, we present our plan to conduct three studies that
  aim to examine the effectiveness of three promising nudging techniques in
  tackling the problem of learners' dropout in professional MOOCs (pMOOCs) and
  increasing their completion rates. The first two nudges are related to
  âpromoting growth mindsetâ and âgoal-settingâ by learners. Two studies will
  be administered in a pMOOC dedicated to professionals and lifelong learners.
  The third study will focus on the âpersonalized assistanceâ nudge. As
  offering such personalized assistance by humans can be impractical in MOOC
  courses with a large number of registered learners, we would instead
  investigate the effectiveness of using pedagogical agents (chatbots).</td>

  American (Latino), Black/African American (AA), and American Indian/Alaska

  the barriers and facilitators to receiving COVID-19 vaccines, acceptability
  of using chatbots to deliver COVID-19 and vaccine information, and preferred
  features and suggestions for culturally tailored prevention messages.
  Positive perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine were mainly derived from beliefs
  that the vaccine can protect oneself and families from getting infected and
  help stop the pandemic. Negative perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine were
  driven by concerns about vaccine safety due to the rapid development process
  and side effects. Latino participants would like to know more information
  about the vaccine and evidence of its effectiveness. AA participants
  identified seeing others, especially government officials, get the vaccine
  first as a facilitator and low trust in the government and healthcare system
  as barriers to getting the COVID-19 vaccine. AI/AN participants emphasized
  the importance of equitable access to the vaccine. Participants preferred
  messages with the following features: informative and evidence-based messages
  about COVID-19 and vaccination, encouraging and motivational messages that
  focused on the hope to end the pandemic and return to normal, prosocial
  messages, and clear instructions for COVID-19 prevention strategies.
  Participants also suggested that messages should include different cultural
  practices, be translated into their native languages, and emphasize care for

  confirmed cases and deaths, which in return leads to a plethora of mental
  disorders across the world. In order to address citizens' psychological
  problems, government agencies in many countries have employed AI-based
  chatbots to provide mental health services. However, there is a limited
  understanding of the determinants affecting citizens' user experience and
  user satisfaction when mental health services supported by chatbots are
  provided. Thus, based on the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV), this study
  proposes an analytical framework to investigate the factors that are
  important to citizens' user experience and user satisfaction when they
  interact with mental health chatbots. Analysis of data collected from 295
  chatbot users in Wuhan and Chongqing reveals that personalization, enjoyment,
  learning, and condition are positively related to user experience and user
  satisfaction. However, voice interaction fails to devote to citizens' user
  experience and user satisfaction. Thus, government agencies and their AI
  service contractors should enhance the functions and systems of mental health
  chatbots to ensure citizens' user experience and user satisfaction. Also,
  they should more positively promote the use of mental health chatbots during
  the public health emergency.</td>
